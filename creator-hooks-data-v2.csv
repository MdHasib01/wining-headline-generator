Title,Framework,Hook Score,Why
"Graphic Design in 2026 — The Tools Every Pro Is Switching To","(Niche) in (Current or upcoming year) — The (Entities) Every Pro Is Switching To","+404","Timeliness – Dropping in the current year does a great job of letting the audience know this is relevant right now, and this is an especially powerful strategy at the turn of the year. Desire – This creator’s audience loves tools. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know which tools they’re talking about."
"5 Boundaries Men MUST Set Early or She’ll Walk All Over You","5 (Entities) (Specific Audience) MUST (Activity) Early or (Problem will occur)","+441","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Fear – The fear of being walked all over does a great job of getting people to click. Urgency – The fact that these boundaries need to be set early brings some urgency to watch this video asap."
"The ONLY Faceless Niches You Should Try in 2026","The ONLY (Entities) You Should Try in (Upcoming or current year)","+634","Scarcity – The word “ONLY” adds a constraint and scarcity and makes these niches way more interesting and valuable. Timeliness – Dropping “in 2026” in the beginning of the year is a great way to get people to click because “2026” is on everybody’s mind right now. It also lets you know that this video is relevant right now. Desire – This creator’s audience loves learning about new faceless niches."
"7 Minutes Only… Do This Every Morning","7 Minutes Only… Do This Every (Specific moment)","+1792","Time Frame – The time frame of “7 minutes” makes this feel more interesting and tangible. Desire – The time frame of “7 minutes only” plus the big promise in the thumbnail text team up to give you the feeling of getting a lot for a little in this video. Moment – Telling people to do something at a specific time makes it more tangible and interesting."
"How to articulate your thoughts more clearly to women you like","","-70","This title is probably too boring. It uses big words and doesn’t convey a clear benefit. When I think about what makes a good title, I think about the three clickworthy emotions: Curiosity



Fear



Desire Does articulating your thoughts more clearly to women you like spark any of these emotions? Maybe desire, but I think there’s a better way we could word it to evoke more emotion. Here are some examples for each one: Curiosity: “The 3-Second Rule Will Change How You Talk To Women Forever” Fear: “How To STOP Freezing When You Talk To Your Crush” Desire: “How To Make Any Woman Fall In Love With You” TLDR: Write clear and emotional titles about your audience’s fears and desires using simple words.

"3 Ways Homeowners Are Quietly Beating Property Taxes Right Now","3 Ways (Specific Audience) Are Quietly Beating (Problem) Right Now","+499","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to beat property taxes. Curiosity – “Quietly” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Specific Audience – By calling out “Homeowners” he makes it clear who this video is for."
"I Built A Gaming Setup Using Only The $1 Store!","I Built A (Cool thing) Using Only (Constraint)!","+571","Constraint – Building a gaming setup is cool, but when you add a constraint, like “Using Only The $1 Store”, it makes it way more interesting."
"Everyone Laughed At His “Useless” Tunnel — Until The Blizzard Hit","Everyone Laughed At His “Useless” (Creation or possession) — Until (Problem)","+2756","Fear & Status – Social status is one of the most important things for us, and people laughing at us is the last thing we want. Curiosity – This builds curiosity in two ways: It starts a story, but doesn’t finish it, so you have to click to see what happened.



There’s a hint of contrast because apparently his “Useless” tunnel wasn’t so useless after all. Editor’s note: Many people want to know what’s working *now* on YouTube… But this title was inspired by an ad that was published in 1926, literally 100 years ago: “They Laughed When I Sat Down At The Piano – But When I Started to Play!”"
"How Old Money Raises Kids.. 9 Rules You Won’t see on Social Media","How Old Money (Activity).. 9 Rules You Won’t see on Social Media","+17","Authority – “Old Money” brings some authority here because they’re successful. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Secret – “You Won’t see on Social Media” makes you feel like these rules are a little bit secretive."
"BlackRock Just Abandoned Your Retirement Strategy (New Playbook)","","-94","It might be me… but I don’t get it? Who cares if BlackRock abandons my retirement strategy? How does that affect me? I think this might’ve done better if it were worded so that its effect on the audience is more obvious. Something like: “BlackRock Just Ruined Your Retirement Strategy (New Playbook)” Also, I don’t love “(New Playbook)” at the end here. I’d probably just get rid of it to make the title cleaner and punchier: “BlackRock Just Ruined Your Retirement Strategy” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"You’re Not Behind (Yet): How to Learn AI in 17 Minutes","You’re Not Behind (Yet): How to Learn [Subject] in [Short time frame]","+419","Fear – This addresses a big fear the audience might have that they’re behind. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to learn AI. Time Frame – The time frame of “17 Minutes” does two things: It adds to the desire because 17 minutes isn’t that long to learn something exciting and valuable.



It makes the video more tangible and specific (and, therefore, more interesting)."
"5 Tricks That End a Traffic Stop Fast (Lawyer Explains)","5 Tricks That End [Problem] Fast ([Authority figure] Explains)","+521","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Desire – Most people would love to end a traffic stop fast. Speed – People love speed and dropping in “Fast” satisfies that desire. Authority – Dropping in “(Lawyer Explains)” adds some trust and credibility to this video."
"Blindsided at Work? Use This One Sentence to Take Your Power Back","(Problem)? Use This One Sentence to (Solve problem)","+6631","Pain Point – This starts with a problem or pain point to grab the right audience’s attention and interest. Desire – People who are blindsided likely want to take their power back. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know what this one sentence is. Scarcity – “This One Sentence” brings more focus on the sentence and makes it more valuable and interesting."
"Many people don’t know the secret of the screws located here.","Many people don’t know the secret of (Specific entity).","+7107","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by talking about a secret."
"“The One Sentence That Gets You A Raise At Work”","","-99","I think this flopped because it’s too vague. What does high status mean? Does it mean a promotion? A raise? And the thumbnail text doesn’t really seem to fit with the title. This video might’ve done better if the title was about a more specific desire and the thumbnail text supported it. Maybe something like: Title: “The One Sentence That Gets You A Raise At Work” Thumbnail text: “Say This To Get A Raise” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"it sucks, but it’ll skyrocket your energy levels…","it sucks, but it’ll (Achieve goal)…","+434","Negativity – Starting this off with “it sucks” adds some tension and fear and grabs the audience’s attention. Curiosity – This builds curiosity in two ways: It opens a loop and makes you wonder what method he’s talking about.



The contrast between “it sucks” and “it’ll skyrocket your energy levels” also builds curiosity. Desire – Most people would love to skyrocket their energy levels. Believability – By admitting that “it sucks”, it makes the bold claim of skyrocketing your energy levels more believable."
"You’re gonna be a full-time creator in 2026, here’s how","You’re gonna (Achieve goal) in (Upcoming year), here’s how","+491","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to be a full-time creator. Timeliness – This was published in December of 2025, while 2026 is on everybody’s mind."
"This One Scene Will Change How You Sell Forever","This One (Entity) Will Change How You (Activity) Forever","+1695","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity in two ways: It opens a loop and makes you want to know what this scene is.



It also opens a loop with “Change How You Sell Forever” because you don’t know what or how your selling will change. Scarcity – By focusing on just a single scene, it increases your interest in the scene. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to get better at selling."
"Megapixels DON’T Matter… But THIS Does","(Common, seemingly important thing) DON’T Matter… But THIS Does","+1958","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity in two ways: It’s counterintuitive that megapixels don’t matter.



It opens a loop and makes you wonder what “THIS” is."
"How To Get Clients To Trust You Step by Step","","-91","This title follows a classic copywriting mistake: it’s about a feature, not a benefit. Why do you care about getting clients to trust you? So you can make more sales. This title might’ve been better if it were about the end goal, like this: “How To Make More Money For Your Agency In 2026 (Step by Step)” Or, if we wanted to add some sauce: “The One Thing You Need To Make More Money As An Agency Owner” Now, do titles about benefits always outperform titles about features? Not necessarily. But you can: A/B test titles to see which one works best



Change a title if the video is not performing well with your initial title



Research before you publish your video to see if titles about your benefit or feature are doing well for your channel and your competitors. Of course, there are plenty of other possible reasons this video could’ve flopped, but those aren’t in the scope of this newsletter Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Secret To Growing $100,000 On A Small Farm (No Tractor Needed!)","The Secret To [Achieving a big goal] [With constraint] ([Biggest excuse eliminated])","+550","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity in two ways: Dropping the word “Secret” is a simple way to build curiosity about your topic.



There’s contrast between “$100,000” (a big gain) and “Small farm”. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to grow $100,000 on their farm. Refute objection – This title refutes two objections: “Small Farm” refutes the objection that you need a big farm to grow $100,000.



Many people might think a tractor is too big and expensive, so “(No Tractor Needed!)” resolves that."
"I Won 3 NCAA Titles…But It Cost Me Everything","I (Achieved big goal)…But It Cost Me Everything","+1399","Credibility – By starting this title with “I Won 3 NCAA Titles”, she shows you her experience and why she’s worth listening to. It also serves up this next reason that makes this title so good… Negativity – People love dramatic stories like this. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity in two ways: There’s contrast between “I Won 3 NCAA Titles” (yay) and “Cost Me Everything” (uh oh).



It opens a loop and makes you wonder what happened and what it cost her."
"What The 1% Teach Their Kids About Money","What The 1% Teach Their Kids About (Niche)","+1478","Authority – The fact that this video is about the 1% makes it feel more credible and desirable. Desire – People want to know what the 1% know about money so they can make more money, too. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what they teach their kids about money. Believability – The fact this is what the 1% teach their kids about money, and not what they’re trying to teach you (and potentially influence you for their gain), makes it more believable. You know they have their kids’ best interests at heart, so it feels more possible that you’ll actually get helpful information."
"The Japanese Rule That Teaches Kids Self-Discipline (Not Blind Obedience)","The [Authoritative culture] Rule That [Achieves goal] (Not [Shallow result])","+4048","Authority – Since many people view Japanese people as self-disciplined, the fact that this the “Japanese Rule” builds more trust and interest. Desire – Many parents want their kids to be more self-disciplined. Refute Objection – Many people don’t want their kids to have blind obedience, so this title refutes that objection"
"Why Every Brand Needs to Know About Pop Culture Trends To Win | Tea with GaryVee 91","","-78","Here are some of this channel’s most popular videos: “How Anyone Can Make $1M in 24 Months: Social Media & Marketing Playbook for 2026” (143K views)



“This Is How You Actually Grow in 2026: Social Media & AI Strategy” (72K views)



“The Ultimate AI Playbook for 2026: Be Early. Go All In.” (141K views) These successful videos feel like they’re all directed at creators or entrepreneurs, but this flop is directed at brands. Now this might be a more profitable video in the short term, but generally speaking, if you’re trying to maximize views and grow your channel long term, you want to make videos for one audience (in this case, brands OR creators). This helps YouTube know who to show your videos to and it makes it easier for people to binge your channel. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"How learning 7+ languages ruined my English","How (Achieving goal) ruined my (Possession)","+733","Curiosity – It’s counterintuitive that a good thing (learning 7+ languages) would have a bad result (ruining her English). Negativity – Nobody wants to ruin their native language skills, so this grabs attention."
"How Many Americans REALLY Have $1 Million or More?","How Many (People) REALLY (Have reached a milestone)?","+1006","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by asking a question. Status – This is all about status, a benchmark, and how the audience compares to everybody else."
"9 Things You Rarely Do for Your Dog (But Should Every Day)","9 Things You Rarely Do for [Possession] (But Should Every Day)","+3160","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – There’s contrast between “rarely” and “every day”, which builds curiosity. Every Day – Telling people about things they should do “every day” makes your video feel more specific and interesting."
"How Often Should You Wash Your Towels? I Bacteria Tested Mine!","How Often Should You (Activity)? I (Entity) Tested Mine!","+11375","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by asking a question. Experience – This title builds trust because it isn’t just her opinion, she actually has proof and experience testing her own towels. Negativity – There’s an undertone of fear that your towels are actually grosser than you think, which makes it more important to watch this video."
"5 Biggest Social Security MYTHS of 2025","","-89","I think there are two main reasons why this flopped: 1) It was published in November of 2025. People are already thinking about 2026, so it might’ve done better if the title was “5 Biggest Social Security MYTHS of 2025”. 2) I’ve covered over 1,400 titles in this newsletter, and only 3 of those titles have the word “myth” in them. It seems like it’s just not that popular of a topic. Another title option to try instead of this list-style title would be to make the title about one of the myths. Since the last myth is that people believe the government has stolen money from Social Security, we could try something like “The Truth About The Government Stealing Money From Social Security”.

"13 Things Older Guitar Students Get WRONG (backed by science)","13 Things [Specific audience] Get WRONG (backed by science)","+844","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Nobody wants to make a mistake or get things wrong, so this title does a great job of grabbing attention and interest. Specific Audience – Calling out a specific audience (“Older Guitar Students” in this case) makes them feel like you made the video specifically for them, so they’re more likely to click. Authority – “(backed by science)” brings some credibility to this title."
"This New Flying Vehicle from China Will Change Travel Forever","This New (Entity) from (Place) Will Change (Entity) Forever","+1236","New – People love new things. Curiosity – “Change Forever” builds curiosity because it tells you that things have changed, but not how they’ve changed. Epic – “Change Forever” also makes this title feel epic and interesting. “China” also brings a lot to this title. Some people have specific feelings about China, but it also just makes the title a little bit more specific, which makes it more interesting."
"5 Powerful Psalms You Need to Read Before the Start of A New Day","5 Powerful (Entities) You Need to (Activity) Before the Start of A New Day","+2219","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Moment – Talking about things that take place at a specific time is a great way to make a video more tangible and interesting."
"Tailors Don’t Want You to Know THIS Secret – Fix ANY Zipper in 2 Minutes!","(Authority figures) Don’t Want You to Know THIS Secret – (Achieve a goal) in (Short time frame)","+7760","Authority – Saying that tailors, the authority figures in this niche, don’t want you to know this secret makes it feel more exciting and conspirational. Curiosity – Talking about secrets is a great, simple way to build curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to fix any zipper in 2 minutes. Time Frame – The time frame of “in 2 Minutes” increases the desire and also makes this video feel more tangible and interesting."
"China’s New Mega Machine Just Broke All the Laws of Physics","","-92","Here are some of this channel’s most popular videos: “This New Flying Vehicle from China Will Change Travel Forever” (682K views)



“China’s New $1,499 Female Robot FINALLY HITS the Market” (307K views)



“This New Chinese Motorcycle Will Change Travel Forever” (435K views) These high-performing videos are all about something specific — mostly travel, but not all about travel. This packaging just seems too vague. I have no idea what I’m looking at in the thumbnail, and the title doesn’t give enough detail for me to know what this video is about. The thumbnail looks like some sort of tunneling machine, so maybe “This New Undergound Tunneling Machine from China Will Change Travel Forever” would be a better title? In summary, if your video flops, you might need to add some more detail to let the audience know what the video is about, who it’s for, and/or why they should care.

"We’ve Lost Control of AI","We’ve Lost Control of (Polarizing topic)","+379","Negativity – People love controversial and scary things like this. Curiosity – This does a great job of starting a story, but not finishing it, so you have to click and see what’s going on. Confirms suspicions – AI’s impressive improvements have often been the main conversation around AI, but there are murmurs of AI getting out of control, and this title brings that fear to the spotlight."
"Become addicted to discipline in 1 day","Become addicted to (Activity or goal) in 1 day","+602","Controversy – Instead of just saying, “how to become disciplined,” this video uses a more controversial phrase: “Become addicted to discipline.” This grabs attention and makes this video feel a little spicy. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to be more disciplined. Time Frame – The time frame of “in 1 day” does two things: It makes it more desirable because it’s such a short time frame and people like speed.



It makes this video feel more tangible and, therefore, more interesting."
"Every Hidden Advantage of Your Body Type Explained In Detail","Every Hidden Advantage of (Attribute) Explained In Detail","+2011","Curiosity – “Hidden Advantage” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Desire – This is all about the viewer and makes them feel special for being the way they are."
"How the Jeep Got Its Name (It’s Not What You Think)","How [Subject] Got Its [Attribute] (It’s Not What You Think)","+2138","Curiosity – “(It’s Not What You Think)” makes you feel like you’re getting in on an unknown secret."
"5 Ways Space Is Actually Good for You","","-77","Here are some of this channel’s high-performing videos: “Ozempic Is Both Better And Worse Than You Think” (910K views)



“We’ve Lost Control of AI” (1.7M views)



“Will Humanity Ever Reach 1 on the Kardashev Scale?” (1.6M views) This title is focused on benefits for the audience, but it seems like the audience is more interested in being entertained. But there’s another issue… The fact that space is actually good for you is kinda irrelevant, since so few of us will ever go to space. I’m probably never gonna go to space, so why do I care if it’s good for me or not? One potential way of reframing this could be, “Weird Ways Space Travel Changes The Human Body”.

"This Job Easily Makes Millionaires… Why Does Nobody Want to Do It?","This (Entity) Easily Makes (Goal)… Why Does Nobody Want to Do It?","+675","Curiosity – This asks a counterintuitive question, which builds tons of curiosity. Why wouldn’t people want to do a job that easily makes millionaires? Desire – Most people would love to easily become a millionaire."
"What No One Tells You About The Worlds Largest Guitar Factory","What No One Tells You About The Worlds Largest (Entity)","+735","FOMO & Secret – “What No One Tells You” gives you a bit of FOMO and makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Epic & Extreme – Extreme things, like “World’s Largest Guitar Factory”, make videos unique and give them an epic feeling."
"The Price of Progress: What Tokyo Looks Like at 8AM","The Price of (Goal): What (Entity) Looks Like at (Specific moment in time)","+1205","Moment – Talking about specific moments (like 8 AM, in this case) does a great job of building curiosity and making a video feel tangible and more interesting. Negativity – “Price of Progress” and the thumbnail let you know this video is about a struggle, and people love a dramatic struggle."
"93% of People Grocery Shop The Wrong Way (Here’s How To Fix It!)","93% of People [Activity] The Wrong Way (Here’s How To Fix It!)","+1402","Negativity – Nobody wants to do something the wrong way, so this grabs the audience’s attention. Curiosity – This builds curiosity in two ways: It opens a loop because it doesn’t give you any specific information about the wrong way to grocery shop, or how to fix it, but it makes you want to know both of those things.



It’s counterintuitive because since when is there a wrong way to do something as simple as grocery shopping?"
"How Resting Squats Completely Healed My Body","","-72","This title isn’t bad, but apparently, the audience wasn’t into it. So what can we do? Well, maybe “resting squats” isn’t exciting enough. We could try this: “How This One Exercise Completely Healed My Body” This adds a bit of scarcity because it focuses on just one exercise and adds some curiosity because we didn’t specify what it is. It’s also possible that “Completely Healed My Body” isn’t powerful enough either. We could try this: “How This One Exercise Completely Changed My Life” Or “How This Simple Exercise Completely Changed My Life” Or “Doing This Simple Exercise Every Day Completely Changed My Life” We added some more curiosity and made it more broadly appealing by being more vague, but still focusing on the benefits.

"Weirdest LEGO Minifigures Ever Made…","Weirdest (Entities) Ever Made…","+550","Curiosity – Using words like “weirdest” (or strangest, oddest, etc) is probably the easiest way to build curiosity. Epic & Extreme- “Weirdest” and “Ever Made” gives this video an extreme and epic feel."
"Never Say These 4 Things at Work (Protect Your Job)","Never [Action] These 4 Things at [Place] (Protect Your [Possession])","+718","Warning – Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing people’s attention. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity."
"9 Strange Habits You Pick Up in the Military","9 Strange Habits You Pick Up (in Entity)","+1693","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Strange – Using words like “strange” (or weird, odd, etc) is probably the easiest way to build curiosity."
"What Mountain Men Understood About Cold That We Forgot","What (Authority Figures) Understood About (Problem) That We Forgot","+20883","Authority – “Mountain Men” are the pros when it comes to surviving the cold. Curiosity – “That We Forgot” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a long-forgotten secret."
"The Dollar-by-Dollar Plan to Your First Rental Property","","-81","This title is probably not clear enough. What exactly does “Dollar-by-Dollar” mean? Is it about exactly how much it costs to buy your first rental property? Maybe that’d be a better title: “Exactly How Much It Costs To Buy Your First Rental Property” He also dropped a great line in his intro: “If I had to start over today, this is exactly what I’d do, paycheck to paycheck”. That angle would probably make a good title, too: “How I’d Buy My First Rental Property (If I Had To Start Over)” Or, since the new year is just around the corner, we could drop “in 2026” in the title: “How I’d Buy My First Rental Property (In 2026)” TLDR: if your video fails at first, try a new angle. And always make sure your titles are clear. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Only Camera They Ever Made That Shoots Like Film","The Only (Entity) They Ever Made That (Achieves big goal)","+783","Scarcity – This video being about the “Only” camera that shoots like film adds scarcity to this title that makes this video and this camera way more interesting. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what this camera is."
"Yes, Your Makeup IS Aging You! | 8 Mistakes You Might Be Making & How To Fix Them","Yes, Your (Possession) IS (Unwanted result)! | 8 Mistakes You Might Be Making & How To Fix Them","+886","Confirms Suspicions – Confirming to your audience that what they suspect is true can be an excellent way to get them to click. “Yes, Your Makeup IS Aging You!” in this title gives them that feeling. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Mistakes – Nobody wants to make mistakes, so mistakes often make for great video topics."
"She’s Shy. She Stutters. Then SHE SINGS… You Won’t Believe It!","(Objection). (Objection). Then (Action)… You Won’t Believe It!","+963","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity in two ways: There’s contrast between shy and stutters, and sings.



It opens a loop and makes you wonder what happens when she sings."
"Marriage Explained in 8 Minutes","(Entity) Explained in 8 Minutes","+1006","Time Frame – The time frame of 8 minutes makes this video feel more tangible and lets you know exactly what to expect. Curiosity – Attempting to explain something so important and complex in a short amount of time builds curiosity."
"This TINY Full Frame Camera Can Do It All.","","-81","I think what went wrong here is “can do it all” just isn’t specific enough. Here’s what this video is about: The one camera and lens he uses to shoot photo and video at the same time.



The accessories, settings, and workflow he uses to do that. Let’s brainstorm a few other titles. He could’ve focused on the constraint and scarcity that this is the single camera he uses to shoot photo and video at the same time: “The ONLY Camera I Use To Shoot Photo & Video” But what if people aren’t interested in shooting photo and video with one camera? I’m not in this niche, so I don’t know if that’s the case, but if it is, we could go with a title like this: “If I Could Have Only ONE Camera, It Would Be This One” People love videos about settings, so another option is to only focus the title on the settings: “The Settings I Use To Shoot Photo & Video With ONE Camera” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Every Major League Baseball Pitch, Explained","Every (Entity), Explained","+599","Desire – This creator’s audience is into MLB pitches. Epic – “Every” makes this video feel complete and kinda gives it an epic feel."
"LAWYER:  NEVER Answer These 3 Police Questions!","(Authority Figure): NEVER (Specific Action)","+671","Authority – Starting this title with “LAWYER” builds trust and credibility in the content. Warning – Warnings like this grab the audience’s attention and add a little bit of stress, which makes people more likely to click your video. List – The list here serves to make this video feel more tangible and interesting, and build curiosity."
"Mechanics HATE These Reset Tips – It Fixes 97% of Car Problems for FREE","(Authority Figures) HATE These (Solutions) – It Fixes 97% of (Entity) Problems for FREE","+6068","Authority & Controversy – By talking about the fact that mechanics (authority figures) hate these tips (controversy), it increases their value. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to fix their car problems for free."
"42 STITCHES You Need To Know And Wardrobe ORGANIZATION Ideas","42 (Specific moves) You Need To Know And (Goal) Ideas","+13571","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience is into stitches and wardrobe organization. Specific – This is about specific stitches, which are very tangible and feel like they’re likely to be helpful. This not the case for abstract things like tips, which may or may not be helpful. Note: I’m typically not a fan of having 2 subjects in a title. I wonder if this video would have done just as well (or even better) if the second part, “And Wardrobe ORGANIZATION Ideas,” was deleted."
"To Hit Driver Straight Always Do This Before Every Swing","To Hit (Achieve Goal) Always Do This Before Every (Action)","+393","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to always hit their driver straight. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know what “This” is. Moment – Talking about a specific moment, like “Before Every Swing” in this case, builds even more curiosity and makes this title more interesting."
"Women getting upset at men doing what they asked for","(Group) getting (Unexpected emotion) at (Requested activity)","+412","Curiosity & Humor – This title builds curiosity and humor because it’s counterintuitive. If men do what the women ask for, wouldn’t they be happy instead of upset?"

"A Once in a Lifetime Economic Reset is Coming.","A Once in a Lifetime (Epic event) is Coming.","+924","Epic – “Once in a Lifetime” makes this topic feel epic. Curiosity – Talking about things that are coming in the future is a simple way to build curiosity because: 1) nobody knows what the future holds, and 2) everybody wants to know what the future holds. Negativity – “Economic Reset” has a negative connotation here (and the thumbnail emphasizes that), and people eat up scary, dramatic events."
"The US is Falling Behind…","","-70","This is a tough one. It seems to be relatively on par with the other titles on this channel, but my guess is there’s one small difference. If somebody told me my baby was ugly, I wouldn’t listen to them. I don’t wanna hear it. I think that’s what’s happening here. I’m guessing this audience is proud Americans and they don’t want to hear the US is falling behind. Instead, it might be better to go with something more neutral, but still curiosity-building, like: “The US Economy Is About To Change Forever…” We could also use negativity, but just be negative about something else: “The Next 3 Months Look Terrifying…” These ideas still gets the same thought across without insulting the audience’s baby.

"These SMALL SHIFTS cut 90% of the drama w/ my kids","These SMALL SHIFTS cut 90% of (Problems)","+632","Negativity – This is all about solving a problem. Curiosity – There’s contrast and tension between “small shifts” (something small) and “cut 90% of the drama” (something big)."
"What Polyglots Understand That Most People Don’t","What (Authority figures) Understand That Most People Don’t","+1306","Authority – Polyglots are the professional athletes of the language learning world, so they bring trust and credibility to this video. FOMO – This makes you feel like you’re missing out on important information polyglots have. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know what they understand."
"What Happens When You Grow a Tomato from a Burger King Whopper?","What Happens When You (Absurd action)?","+2845","Curiosity – This builds curiosity in two ways: It asks a question.



More powerfully, it asks an impossible or weird question. The absurdity of growing a tomato from a Burger King Whopper is what makes this video so interesting."
"This 1-Minute Introduction Makes You Unforgettable","This 1-Minute (Entity) Makes You (Desired state)","+15218","Time Frame – The time frame of “1-Minute” does two things here: It makes this introduction feel more tangible and interesting.



It makes it feel more achievable since it’s so short. Desire – This channel’s audience would love to be unforgettable. Curiosity – This builds curiosity in two ways: It opens a loop and makes you want to know what the framework is.



There’s contrast between “1-Minute Introduction” (short and easy) and becoming unforgettable (a huge benefit)."
"Screen time? Chore charts? Alone time? Clutter quandaries?!","","-75","We’ve got a good ol’ fashioned Q&A video here. My #1 rule of YouTube titles: keep them clear and simple, but 4 questions in a title don’t qualify as clear and simple. So what can we do? Option #1: Write the title addressing just the most interesting question. Example: “The #1 Rule That Keeps My Kids Happy Without Screen Time” Option #2: Hype up the questions. Example: “Answering Controversial Questions About Mom Life” Note: if you’re gonna do this, this obviously needs to be decided ahead of time, so you can pick controversial questions (or at least position the questions as controversial). Option #3: Use a time frame. Example: “32 Minutes of Advice For Struggling Moms” Or “32 Minutes Answering Difficult Questions For Struggling Moms” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

Desire – This creators audience would love to speak clearer. Regret – There’s a hint of regret with “(I Wish I Knew Sooner)” to increase the value of these habits.

"Las Vegas Is Only For Rich People Now. No Wonder It’s Empty.","(Entity) Is Only For (Negative entity) Now. No Wonder It’s (Negative state).","+1286","Negativity – People are drawn to dramatic, resentful, conspirational statements like this."
"The Japanese Student Routine That Helps You Remember EVERYTHING","The (Authority) Routine That Helps You (Achieve Big Goal)","+2451","Authority – Many people respect Japanese students, so labeling this the “Japanese Student Routine” builds credibility and increases the audience’s desire to watch it. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to remember everything."
"What I learned from one year of running a print store (and fixing my desk setup)","","-74","I think there are a few reasons this title flopped. First, it doesn’t really have a focus. Running a print store and fixing his desk setup seem too disjointed to grab the audience’s attention and get them excited. Second, there’s not much emotion. This is largely because the desk setup bit is more of a distraction than an enhancement. Here are some ways we could make it more focused and more emotional: “What I learned from one year of running a print store (this changed my life)” “Everything I learned running a failed print store for a year” “My biggest regret about running a print store after 1 year” “If I was going to start a print store in 2026, I’d do this” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"What actually WORKED to Learn FRENCH (No Apps, No Hacks)","What actually WORKED to [Achieve goal] (No [Common, but unwanted solutions])","+368","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to know what will actually work to help them learn French. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what it is that actually worked. Refute Objection – Many people who’ve tried to learn French are sick of apps and hacks, so this title refutes that objection with, “(No Apps, No Hacks).”"
"This Meal Prep Has 70g of Protein and Tastes Like a Cheat Meal","This (Entity) Has (Benefits)","+575","Desire – This lists out two benefits: 70g of Protein

It’s about people you should not help"
"You Need to Be Bored. Here’s Why.","You Need to Be (Bad state or action). Here’s Why.","+2782","Curiosity – Counterintuitive statements like this do a great job of building curiosity and getting people to click."
"This Can Make or Break Your Retirement","","-87","The wording in this title is a little weak. It’s a cliche, it doesn’t take a side, and there’s no strong opinion. I think it might’ve done better if it were about either making retirement or breaking retirement, but not “make or break.” Here are some examples of what I mean: Making retirement: “5 Things That Will Make Retirement EASY” “99% Of People Don’t Know The Secret To A Great Retirement” Breaking retirement: “5 Things That Will Ruin Your Retirement” “99% Of People Are Accidentally Making This Retirement Mistake” These two sets of titles take a bolder stance and avoid clichés.

"This Winter Is Looking VERY Weird…","(Upcoming entity) Is Looking VERY Weird…","+661","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity in two ways: It’s about the future, and since the future is unknown, it’s a naturally curiosity-filled topic.



The word “weird” also sparks curiosity because it means this video is about something different than normal, and people want to know what’s different about it."
"I built one website 20 times— to find the BEST website builder","I (Activity) 20 times— to find the BEST (Tool)","+768","Credibility – This title builds trust because it’s not just an opinion of some website builders, he’s showing proof that he put in a lot of effort to find the truth. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to know about the best website builder."
"They Promised to Make Social Security Tax-Free — But Here’s What They’re Doing Instead","They Promised to (Benefit)— But Here’s What They’re Doing Instead","+840","Negativity – Talking about what “They” promised to do, but aren’t doing, is a great way to give your title a feeling of drama and conspiracy, which is intoxicating to many viewers. Curiosity – “But Here’s What They’re Doing Instead” opens a loop so you have to click to find out what they’re doing."
"Don’t Buy a SINGLE Thing at Marshalls Until You Watch This!","Don’t (Activity) a SINGLE (Entity) at (Place) Until You Watch This!","+1200","Negativity – Warnings with urgency like this do a great job of grabbing the audience’s attention and getting them to click. The word “SINGLE” also does a few things: it makes this title feel more focused, intense and confident."
"Are You Feeling Broke? How to Build Real Financial Security","","-80","Here’s my hot take: You should never ask a question in your title. Yes, they can work occasionally, but for the most part, you’re better off making a bold statement. Here are some ways we could rewrite this title: “How to Build Real Financial Security (Even If You Feel Broke)” “If You Feel Broke, Do THIS to Build Real Financial Security” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Worst Snake Bites in the US Ranked","The Worst (Entities) Ranked","+582","Negativity – People are drawn to scary things like this. Epic & Extreme – “The Worst” is way more exciting and interesting than just “Really Bad.”"
"SECRET Weapon for a MOLD-FREE Home (It’s Not What You Think)","SECRET Weapon for a [Problem]-FREE [Entity] (It’s Not What You Think)","+613","Curiosity – This makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret in two ways: “SECRET Weapon” obviously makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret.



“(It’s Not What You Think)” reinforces that feeling. Negativity & Desire – This is all about a problem and solution: having a mold-free home."

"The Feminine Hygiene Routine No One Taught Us","The (Entity) No One Taught Us","+2247","Curiosity – “No One Taught Us” gives you a little bit of FOMO and makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Taboo – Taboo, sensitive, or personal things like feminine hygiene do a great job of grabbing people’s attention."
"Scrub Daddy all that? Let’s find out!","","-70","This title feels a little too clever and clunky. I think, “all that,” specifically, is too unclear, so here’s how we might reword it: “These Sponges Are BETTER Than The Scrub Daddy” This is more clear and states a bold opinion. But let’s say that the title I wrote above still doesn’t work. What then? Well, it’s possible “Scrub Daddy” isn’t the best subject to focus the title on. Here are some other options: “Everything You Need To Know About Cleaning Sponges” “I Tested The Top Cleaning Sponges – Here’s The Best One” “This Changes Everything I Thought I Knew About Sponges” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"I took an “entry level” CIA test","I took a (“easy” version of hard thing)","+727","Tension – The tension of doing something hard, like taking a CIA test, makes for an interesting and exciting video.

"Gore-Tex Sued for Lying to their Customers","","-92","This is some spicy drama, which people normally love. So what happened? Well, “They Cut Down The World’s Tallest Tree!” (819K views) is a similar title and did really well for this channel, but this one is slightly different. Gore-Tex getting sued feels like the corporate drama we tree huggers are trying to avoid, while cutting down a massive tree feels like an attack on something we deeply care about. It’s a slight, but significant difference that can have a big impact on views. Here are some questions to avoid a flop like this: Does this match why my audience watches my channel?



Has this topic done well for my channel (or at least my competitors) before?



Is this topic something my target audience is interested in? Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Social Media Is About to Change Forever (and nobody even realises)","[Entity] Is About to Change Forever (and nobody even realises)","+625","Curiosity – This leverages curiosity in two ways: “Change Forever” opens a loop and makes you want to know what changed and how.



“(and nobody even realises)” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Epic – “Change Forever” also makes this video feel epic."
"The Day the World Changed FOREVER – Hiroshima: Minute by Minute","The Day (Entity) Changed FOREVER – (Entity): Minute by Minute","+1223","Negativity – People can’t get enough of dramatic events like this. Specific – This is specific in two ways: It’s about a single day.



It goes through that day minute by minute. Many people think being vague in your titles builds curiosity and makes people want to watch your video, and it can, but talking about specific details like this often does a great job of building curiosity and interest, too. Epic – Like in the social media video above, “Changed Forever” makes this video feel epic."
"99% Of People STILL Don’t Know The Basics Of Prompting (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude)","99% Of People STILL Don’t Know The Basics Of (Action or niche)","+1455","Beginner – Making videos for beginners, in this case, talking about “the basics,” is a great way to attract a large audience that’s eager to learn.

Controversy – Adding “It Feels ILLEGAL” brings some spice and controversy, and makes this video feel more interesting. Refute Objection – Most people think you need to be motivated to be productive, but this title gets rid of that assumption with “(No Motivation Needed).”"
"20 SECRETS In Video Games","","-81","This title seems pretty good — it’s a list about secrets. So what happened? My theory is that it’s not specific enough. What are the secrets about? What are the consequences of these secrets? For what game? Who should watch this video? Here are some ways we could answer these questions for more tangible, interesting titles: “20 Secret Cheat Codes In Video Games” “20 Secret Easter Eggs In Video Games” “20 Mario Kart Secrets You’ve Never Seen” “20 Secrets Every Adult Gamer Needs To See” “20 Secrets That Prove Game Developers Are Amazing Humans” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Don’t Throw It Away! Here’s How to Save Clothes That Got Too Tight","Don’t (Expected action)! Here’s How to Save (Unsalvagable things)","+506","Negativity – This starts with a warning to grab your attention. Curiosity – This is counterintuitive because you’d think clothes that are too tight can’t be saved. Desire – This audience would love to save clothes that don’t fit anymore."
"Top 10 1960s Protest Songs That Still Resonate Today","Top 10 (Nostalgic, controversial things) That Still (Action) Today","+1098","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – There’s contrast between “1960s Songs” and “Still Resonate Today”. Nostalgia – Nostalgia works great for many niches.

"2025: The end of our world as we know it | Peter Leyden","(Current or Upcoming Year): The end of (Entity) as we know it","+8695","Negativity – Drama and controversy like this do a great job of grabbing attention. Timeliness – This drops in the current year to let you know this is relevant right now. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what’s going to happen to our world."
"Why Automakers Can’t Move Factories Overnight","","-73","If you want to build curiosity in your titles, you need to spark a question in your audience’s mind that they want answers to. This title might spark a question, but you don’t need to watch the video because the answer is obvious. Of course Automarkers can’t move factories overnight! That sounds way too difficult. This video is about tariffs, and it might’ve done better if it focused on the problems buyers and manufacturers are facing, rather than asking an obvious question. Maybe something like, “The REAL Problem With Manufacturing Cars In The U.S.” or “Tariffs Will Change The Way We Buy Cars Forever”. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

Curiosity – “Subtle Signs” and “Most Parents Miss” build curiosity because it feels like you’re getting in on some secret insider knowledge."
"How Farmers Walks Completely Change The Human Body","How (Activity or thing) Completely Change (Possession)","+1145","Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it’s about change, but it doesn’t specify what will change or how it will change. Desire – The thumbnail and tone of this title hint that the change is something awesome."
"95% Tax on Inherited IRAs and How to AVOID it!","(Problem) and How to AVOID it!","+2106","Negativity – Videos about avoiding big problems like this do a great job of grabbing attention."
"Why Your Body FEELS 10 Years Older Than It Is (And how to fix it)","","-98","I’m not sure of one particular reason this flopped, but here are some ideas: Most of the successful videos are about certain exercises, so a title like, “Do These Exercises Every Morning To Stop Feeling Stiff,” might’ve been a better approach.



It might’ve been more effective and clear to say “Why You’re 40 But FEEL 50 (And how to fix it)”. That states the “feel 10 years older” in more easier-to-read terms. Of course, it also narrows the audience, so that would depend on the channel’s audience whether or not it makes sense to narrow the focus.



It also might’ve been more effective if the title were more focused on a specific pain, like “Why Your Back Hurts Every Morning (And how to fix it)”. In summary, know why people watch your channel and deliver on that, and use simple, visual language in your titles. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"5-Minute No Foundation Makeup With Just 5 Products | Quick & Easy Everyday Look","5-Minute No (Typical, but unwanted tactic) (Activity) With (Constraint) | Quick & Easy (Entity)","+920","Time Frame – The time frame of 5 minutes makes this more tangible and desirable. Constraint – The constraints of this makeup only requiring 5 products, not requiring any foundation, and only taking 5 minutes, make it more interesting and appealing. List – The list of 5 products adds curiosity because you want to know what they are. Refute Objection – If you don’t like foundation, this title gets rid of that objection by promising you don’t need it. Desire – This creator’s audience is into makeup, and “Quick & Easy” adds to the desire."
"This One Parking Trick Works EVERY Time.","This One (Activity) Trick Works EVERY Time.","+2152","Constraint – The fact that this is about just one trick makes you more interested in the trick and increases the value of it. It also makes for an easier decision to watch this video — you just need to learn about one trick to help your parking, not a list of 20. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what the trick is. Desire – This creator’s audience is into parking tricks. Absolute – Words like “Every”, “Any”, “Always”, and “Never” often work great on YouTube because people are drawn to strong, bold opinions."
"This Walking Secret Melts Belly Fat After 50 (No Hard Cardio)","This [Easy activity] Secret [Achieves big goal] [Specific Audience] (No [Unwanted, but typically necessary activity])","+2550","Desire – This leverages desire in two ways: Most people would love to melt belly fat.



Doing something easy like walking to melt belly fat sounds incredible. Curiosity – Making videos about secrets is a simple, but effective way to build curiosity. Specific Audience – When you call out a specific audience, like “After 50”, it makes them feel like your video was made specifically for them, and they’re more likely to click. Refute Objection – Many people don’t want to do hard cardio to lose weight, but this title gets rid of that objection by promising “No Hard Cardio.”"
"NEVER Say This in a Job Interview (or You’re DONE)","NEVER [Activity] This in a [High stakes situation] (or You’re DONE)","+9783","Negativity – Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing the audience’s attention. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what “This” is."
"Stop Guessing! Use This Cabin Trick to Avoid Scratches","","-74","The very first thing that came to my mind when I read this was, “What am I guessing at?” I didn’t have any context when I first read “Stop Guessing!” and the exclamation mark told me that the first sentence was over, so for a split second, I was confused. Definitely not the first emotion you want someone to experience when they read your title. Unfortunately, as I kept reading, I got even more confused. I haven’t really heard the term “Cabin” much in reference to cars. I know what it means, but it’s just not a term I hear that often, so it took me a second to understand what I was reading. I’m not necessarily a car guy, so maybe I’m not the right audience, but ideally, your title is easily understood by everybody. So there are two things I’d fix here: I’d remove the “Stop Guessing!” part of the title and just get straight to the meat of it.



I’d swap out “cabin trick” for a word or term more people are familiar with, like “hood trick” or “windshield trick.” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Give me 15 Minutes and I’ll Make you Dangerously Confident","Give me 15 Minutes and I’ll Make you (Desirable attribute)","+1376","Desire – Most people would love to be dangerously confident Time Frame – The time frame of 15 minutes does 2 things here: It makes this video more tangible and interesting.



It increases the desire because 15 minutes isn’t that long to become dangerously confident. Drama – “Dangerously Confident” sounds a lot cooler and adds more drama and spice than just “Confident”."
"How to run so fast it feels unnatural","How to (Do an activity so well) it feels unnatural","+1466","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to run faster. Another element at work here is, “show don’t tell.” If this title were “how to run really fast,” that probably wouldn’t have been as effective as running “so fast it feels unnatural.”"
"How to DESTROY your exam like it owes you money (by a straight A engineering student)","How to DESTROY your [Entity] like it owes you money (by a [Authority figure])","+1764","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to destroy their exam. Authority – This creator builds trust by dropping that he’s a straight-A engineering student at the end.

"DON’T DONATE your clothes (do this instead)","DON’T [Common, beneficial action] (do this instead)","+1003","Negativity – Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing attention. Curiosity – This builds curiosity in two ways: It’s counterintuitive. Isn’t donating your clothes a good thing?



“do this instead” opens a loop and makes you wonder what the alternative is."
"3 simple tips to unlock ChatGPT GENIUS mode…","3 simple tips to unlock (tool) GENIUS mode…","+1246","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Desire – This leverages desire 3 ways: This creator’s audience would love to get better results with ChatGPT.



Everybody loves “simple” tips.



And “Genius mode” is just such a cool name that increases the value of the video."
"9 Celebrities Who Risked It All to Follow Jesus","9 Celebrities Who Risked It All to (Action or goal)","+1570","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about), and they add some curiosity. Controversy – “Risking it all” adds conflict and controversy, raising the stakes of this video to make it more interesting."
"Make This for Your Next Wine Night to Impress Everyone | America’s Test Kitchen","","-70","I love that this title is about status — impressing everyone. But why did it do so poorly compared to other videos on the channel? Two reasons: 1) When you first glanced at the thumbnail, did you immediately know what it was? Maybe I’m just a simple man with simple tastes, but it took me a second to realize what I was looking at. It might’ve done better if it were a slightly clearer image of clams (they are clams, right?). Here’s a quote to remember when making your titles and thumbnails: “If you confuse, you lose.” 2) I also love that this title is about a specific moment: making food for wine night. But how many people in this audience are making food for wine night? It’s possible it’s not that popular of a moment, or the audience isn’t struggling to make food for that moment. If they wanted to get away from the wine night angle, they could try a title that just hypes up the clams, like, “These 10-Minute Steamed Clams Will Change Your Life”.

"How Japan escaped Obesity while America got Fat","How (Entity) escaped (Problem) while (Entity) (Suffered from problem)","+724","Negativity – This is all about a well-known problem, which grabs attention. Desire – This offers a little bit of hope. If Japan escaped this problem, maybe there’s a solution. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder how Japan escaped this problem (and what’s wrong with Americans that made them get fat)."
"11 Hidden Flight Tricks Airlines are Keeping Quiet About On Purpose!","11 Hidden (Niche) Tricks (Authorities) are Keeping Quiet About On Purpose!","+1096","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – “Hidden” and “Keeping Quiet About On Purpose” both make you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Authority – The fact that “Airlines” are the ones keeping these tricks quiet makes them feel more credible. Desire – This creator’s audience is into flight tricks. And I feel like “On Purpose” makes these tricks seem even more valuable."
"How To Make Drawing 5x Times Easier","How To Make (Activity) 5x Times Easier","+2388","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to make drawing easier. “5x” makes this video feel more tangible and interesting than just “How To Make Drawing Easier”."
"I Went To All 30 MLB Ballparks (Here Are My Rankings)","I Went To All [Entities] (Here Are My Rankings)","+5741","Interest – This creator’s audience is interested in how the MLB ballparks compare. Credibility – Since he’s gone to all 30, his opinion is more trustworthy. Complete – Words like “all”, “every”, and “any” make videos feel more complete and interesting."
"11 Airport Secrets They DON’T Want Us to Know in 2025!","","-98","This video was published in May of 2025, so “in 2025” just isn’t that powerful anymore because it’s closer to the middle of the year. If this were published in December, January, February, or March, it might’ve done better. Plus, the thumbnail is too vague. The curiosity sweet spot is right in the middle of “I have no idea what this is” and “I know exactly what this is.” The thumbnail points to something that’s way too far on the “I have no idea what this is” side, so it doesn’t build enough curiosity. If you want to avoid a flop like this, use a better angle than “in 2025” if it’s in the middle of the year, and make the imagery in your thumbnails more specific.

"How to STOP a DOG ATTACK in 3 Seconds – GUARANTEED!","How to STOP a (Problem) in (Short time frame) – GUARANTEED!","+999","Negativity – This uses fear to grab your attention. Time Frame – The time frame of “in 3 Seconds” makes this feel more tangible and increases the desire to watch this video since it’s so short."
"Avoid These 3 Cabinets At ALL Costs","Avoid These 3 (Entities) At ALL Costs","+1414","Negativity – This warning does a great job of grabbing attention. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – This makes you wonder what these 3 cabinets are."
"The Quick Guide to Baseball Pitch Grips","The Quick Guide to (Entities)","+1448","Desire – This creator’s audience is into baseball pitch grips. Speed – People love speed and “Quick Guide” promises that. The time frame of “in 2 minutes” in the thumbnail also adds to the speed and desire."
"7 Signs You Are WAY Above Average (Shocking Money Stats!)","7 Signs You Are WAY Above Average (Shocking [Niche] Stats!)","+1996","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Status – Everybody wants to know how they compare against other people."
"How to Grade Your Dog’s Behavior: From F to A","","-87","People love benchmarks and seeing how they compare, so why did this flop? My guess is that people don’t want to grade their dog’s behavior, they want to skip that step and just have a better-behaved dog. The thumbnail hints at that, but the title doesn’t. It might’ve done better if it were, “How to Turn Your Dog’s Behavior From F to A”. Or, to be even more direct, we could try, “How to Turn Your Crazy Dog Into a Calm, Obedient Dog”. The lesson: write your title about the end goal the audience will get, not about the difficult journey they have to go on. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"I Renovated This $1 House (Start to Finish)","I [Activity] This $1 [Entity] (Start to Finish)","+589","Desire – This leverages desire two ways: This creator’s audience loves renovations.



Since the house was only $1, some people feel like they could do this, too. Curiosity – $1 house builds so much curiosity because it makes you ask all sorts of questions, like: How in the world did she get a $1 house?



How bad of shape is a $1 house?



What does it look like now? A $1 house is kind of an oxymoron because it just doesn’t seem possible."
"This #1 Golf coach PROVES You’re HITTING driver all wrong!!","This (Authority Figure) PROVES You’re (Activity) all wrong!!","+635","Authority – #1 Golf coach brings attention, trust and credibility to this video. Negativity – This is all about a pain point: hitting your driver all wrong. Credibility – This might be a little weak, but “PROVES” sounds more credible and believable than just “explains why” or something. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know how this coach proves you’re hitting your driver all wrong."
"Ex-CIA Officer Reveals 5 Signs Your Phone’s Been Hacked","(Authority Figure) Reveals 5 Signs (Problem has happened)","+895","Authority – “Ex-CIA Officer” brings authority and trust to this video. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This leverages the fear of your phone getting hacked to grab your attention."
"3 Sound Design Secrets That Feel Like CHEATING","3 (Activity or Niche) Secrets That Feel Like CHEATING","+1440","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to improve their sound design. Curiosity – “Secrets” is a great, simple way to build curiosity. Negativity – “CHEATING” brings some controversy here that grabs the audience’s attention."
"Is a Backup Gun Necessary for Self-Defense?","","-93","Here’s a strategy that I’ve heard a lot of people recommend: Take questions your audience has asked and just make videos answering them. Sometimes that’s a good strategy, but sometimes it leads to very specific videos that don’t resonate with a large part of your audience. That’s what this video feels like to me. But even with this very specific idea, I think the title could still be better. Titles that are bold opinions often do better on YouTube than questions like this. This video might have done better if the title was more opinionated, like: “Here’s Why You Don’t Need A Backup Gun For Self-Defense” Or it could’ve taken more of a personal opinion and story angle: “Here’s Why I Never Carry A Backup Gun Anymore” Or, if the topic of backup guns just isn’t cutting it for the audience, we could make it more broad. Something like, “This Popular Self-Defense Hack Is A Waste Of Time & Money”. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"30 Habits That (Quietly) Changed My Life Forever","30 Habits That (Quietly) [Achieved Goal]","+1092","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to change their life. Curiosity – “(Quietly)” kinda makes this feel like you’re getting in on a secret."
"Nintendo is ALREADY BANNING Switch 2","(Entity) is ALREADY (Negative Action) (Entity)","+1734","Negativity – People love drama like this. Curiosity – The word “Already” makes this feel like the ban at this time came as a surprise and makes you wonder why they’re banning it so soon. News – People love news like this."
"Do Snap Swivels REALLY Hurt Lure Action? (Side-by-Side Look Underwater)","Do (Entities) REALLY Hurt (Desired outcome)? ([Proof of evidence])","+2138","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question, and the “REALLY” enhances that curiosity. Negativity – This is about avoiding a problem (hurting your lure action). Credibility – By promising a side-by-side underwater look, this video feels more credible and believable."
"Every Font is Free","Every (Entity) is Free","+3755","Desire – This creator’s audience would love for every front to be free. Curiosity – This is counterintuitive because many fonts are not free. This combo of desire + curiosity makes this video feel too good to be true, but there’s a sliver of hope, so you’ve gotta watch it if you’re a font guy or gal."
"The 1 Bass Spawning Behavior I DIDN’T Expect (Dock Cam Footage)","","-71","This creator’s audience has one goal: catch more bass. My guess is that although bass spawning behavior can be related to catching bass, it’s a few steps away. It takes a bit of mental work for the audience to realize that this video can help them with their main goal. And since most people are mindlessly scrolling on YouTube, any amount of mental work is often too much work, so they scroll on by and choose another video. A super simple change might be just: “The 1 Bass Behavior I DIDN’T Expect (Dock Cam Footage)” (just remove the word “spawning.”) You could also try a more dramatic title with a broader angle: “Underwater Video Changes Everything I Thought I Knew About Bass” TLDR: Know why people watch your videos and have your titles reflect that, and make your titles super simple to read and understand.

"Don’t start practicing art before you’ve done THIS","Don’t start (Activity) before you’ve done THIS","+1618","Negativity – Warning someone to not do something does a great job at grabbing their attention. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know what “THIS” is. Urgency – This makes you feel like you need to watch this now."
"The One Choice That Will Determine Your Next 5 Years","The One (Action) That Will Determine (Future)","+4094","Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: It opens a loop and makes you wonder what the choice is.



Since it’s about just one choice, this constraint raises the stakes of that one choice and makes it more interesting. Time Frame – The time frame of “Your Next 5 Years” also raises the stakes of this one choice."
"The SECRET Powder That Makes Plants Grow Faster & Repels Pests!","The SECRET (Entity) That (Achieves goal) & (Removes problem)!","+4451","Curiosity – Using the word “Secret” is a simple way to build curiosity and make the audience feel like they’re getting in on a secret. Desire – This audience would love for their plants to grow faster. Negativity – They would also love to repel pests."
"Getting ADDICTED to STUDYING is Easy, Actually","Getting ADDICTED to (Beneficial, but hard activity) is Easy, Actually","+17518","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to study more. The confident tone of this title makes you feel like this video can help you. Curiosity – Many people struggle with studying, so saying it’s “Easy, Actually,” is counterintuitive. Controversy – Saying getting “ADDICTED” to studying is more bold, polarizing, and controversial than just, “studying more,” so it grabs more attention. Contrast – The contrast between “ADDICTED” (negative connotation) and “STUDYING” (positive connotation) makes this title more interesting."
"The Battle Between Elon, Trump & The Left – Naval Ravikant","","-82","People love drama, so the idea of this sounds great, but I think part of the reason it flopped because it’s too complicated. Specifically, I think there are too many nouns. Elon, Trump, The Left, Naval Ravikant — these four nouns make this title hard to digest. One thing they could do is take a stand and write the title about just one of the sides: “Why Trump Is Dominating The Left – Naval Ravikant” (I’m not saying that’s true or what this video is about — just using this as an example.) You could also argue that since this video has so few views compared to the rest of the channel, people aren’t interested in this battle. Part of this video is about power, and since this channel is about improving yourself, that could be an interesting focus for the title. The title could be something like, “Why Leaders Today Have More Power Than Any Other Man In History.” TLDR: Take a bold stance, or change the subject of the title if your video is struggling.

"WTF Happened In 1971?","WTF Happened In (Specific time)?","+1859","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a big, bold question. The thumbnail complements this perfectly by showing that something big happened in 1971."
"You Don’t Want Love—You Want to Be Picked So You Feel Worthy","You Don’t Want (Desirable entity)—You Want (True desire)","+1945","Curiosity – “You Don’t Want Love” is counterintuitive to people who assume they want love. Negativity – Telling people what they don’t want does a great job of grabbing attention. Desire – This resonates with the audience and reveals to them what they truly desire. Note: This format is only effective if you know your audience’s hopes, desires, and fears. The best creators know their audiences better than their audience knows themselves."
"I Left The U.S. For India And Built A $23M Burrito Business","I Left (Advantageous place) For (Seemingly less advantageous place) And (Achieved big goal)","+2444","Curiosity – This builds curiosity three ways: It’s counterintuitive because you think he’d have a better chance at building a $23M business in the U.S. than in India.



It’s counterintuitive that a burrito business can be so big.



And maybe I’m just an ignorant Florida man, but I don’t associate burritos with India, so that’s also counterintuitive. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to build a $23M business (bonus points if it involves burritos)."
"50 Recognizable songs you don’t know the name of","50 Recognizable (Entities) (Counterintuitive statement)","+3562","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – The contrast between “recognizable songs” and “you don’t know the name of” builds curiosity."
"What It Really Takes To Transform Vehicles Into Homes","","-99","One of the golden rules of marketing is to talk about benefits, not features. This title feels like it’s doing the opposite — talking about features, not benefits. Talking about “what it really takes” isn’t as exciting as what you actually get: a sweet home made out of a vehicle. If it were me, that’s what I’d focus my title on. Something like, “Turning A Van Into Your Home Will Change Your Life Forever”. This is focused more on what you get (change your life forever) than what it takes. Here’s the lesson: think about the outcome your audience will get from your video, and make the title about that. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"How Hackers Steal Passwords: 5 Attack Methods Explained","How (Bad guys) (Negative action): 5 (Negative action) Methods Explained","+2196","Negativity – This is all about controversy and the fear of hackers, getting your password stolen, and attack methods. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Authority – This isn’t just about how your password gets stolen, it’s about how Hackers do it, which brings some credibility and authority."
"ACCOUNTANT EXPLAINS: The 6 Levels of Wealth In America","(Authority Figure) EXPLAINS: The 6 Levels of (Entity)","+2564","Authority Figure – “ACCOUNTANT EXPLAINS” brings trust and credibility to this video. Curiosity – Things like levels and rankings are interesting and build curiosity. Status – This caters to people’s self-interest because it’s all about where you rank compared to others."
"How To RAISE A CONFIDENT CHILD! Without Forcing THEM Out Of Their SHELL","How To (Achieve goal)! Without (Unwanted action)","+11492","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to raise a confident child. Refute Objection – Many people might think they have to force their child out of their shell in order to get them to become confident, but this title refutes that objection."
"What You NEED To Know About FORGIVENESS In Your 20s","","-90","I like this title, but if I had to guess, the audience just isn’t into forgiveness. But here’s the thing: sometimes your audience doesn’t care about your video topic, even though it might be exactly what they need to hear. In this case, you can try to write the title about the outcome or pain, rather than the actual video subject. Here are some examples: “If your damaged soul is holding you back, you need to watch this” “Once I learned this, I stopped beating myself up” “The Small Mindset Shift That Changed My Life Forever” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Have Humanoid Robots Gone Too Far?","Have (Polarizing, progressive entity) Gone Too Far?","+446","Negativity – People love the controversy of things going too far. Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question. Timeliness – Humanoid robots are trending more and more as technology improves."
"This Cut Of Beef Is Better And Cheaper Than Prime Rib!","This (Entity) Is (More desirable) Than (Best current option)!","+946","Desire – This creator’s audience loves prime rib and something better and cheaper than prime rib sounds awesome. Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it doesn’t tell you what the cut of beef is, so you have to click to find out."
"You Were the Smart Kid. So Why Do You Feel So Lost Now?","You Were the (Accomplished past state). So Why Do You Feel So (Negative emotion) Now?","+841","Negativity – This calls out a pain point that grabs people’s attention and interest. Specific Audience – This calls out a very specific audience with “You Were the Smart Kid,” to grab the right audience’s attention and make them feel like this video was made for them. Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question."
"Here’s How To Make Your Assets Invisible From Creditors","Here’s How To Make Your (Possession) Invisible From (People who want to take advantage of possession)","+1863","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to make their assets invisible from creditors. Negativity – This video is about avoiding a problem. I also think a big part of this video’s success is that the word “invisible” is such a great word. It feels secretive, powerful and cool."
"Make This Iconic Sandwich At Home!","","-75","If you want to write great titles, you need to know your audience. You need to know their fears, desires, obstacles, and problems. And keeping that in mind, I think one of the reasons this video flopped is because making this iconic sandwich at home just isn’t a big problem for them. It might’ve been better to make the focus of the title about a different problem, like price or time: “Make This Iconic Sandwich For Under $5!” “Make This Iconic Sandwich In 5 Minutes!” There’s also the possibility that this creator’s audience is into big hunks of meats, not sandwiches, so maybe this video was doomed from the start. But that’s why we do thorough research, right? Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"San Antonio’s BEST & WORST Suburbs Ranked","(Entity’s) BEST & WORST (Entities) Ranked","+520","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to hear about the best San Antonio suburbs. Negativity – The “worst” San Antonio suburbs grabs attention because this audience definitely does not want to move there. Curiosity – Everybody likes to see how things rank and compare against each other."
"STOP buying protein bars. Make these instead.","STOP (Action) (Entity). (Action) these instead.","+625","Negativity – The big “STOP” in all caps does a great job of grabbing your attention. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what “these” are. The first part is also a little counterintuitive — why would you stop buying protein bars?"
"How much progress have we made on climate change?","How much progress have we made on (Big problem)?","+850","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question many people are probably wondering in the back of their minds. Negativity – Climate change is a global problem that many people are aware of and interested in."

Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what it is God wants you to hear. Authority – I’m not sure if this is just relevant to this niche and this video, but if God wants you to hear something, that’s a pretty powerful sign you need to hear it."
"50 AND FABULOUS: COSY COMFY STYLE FOR WOMEN","","-64","The best titles are clear and simple. This title doesn’t really fit that. “50 AND FABULOUS” is too clever and vague, and dilutes the main idea of the title: “COSY COMFY STYLE FOR WOMEN.” Here are some other options we could try: We could try calling out a pain point and dropping in the current year: “How To Dress Stylish In 2025 (Without Being Uncomfortable)” We could add a little curiosity by making it about a secret: “The Secret To Dressing Stylish AND Comfy” Or we could use a similar format to the outlier above this section: “If you want to dress stylish and cosy, you need to watch this.” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"We Found a Snake BIGGER Than Titanoboa!","We Found a (Entity) (Extreme comparative adjective) Than (Entity previously considered most extreme)!","+781","Epic – People love epic things, and finding a snake bigger than what was previously thought to be the biggest definitely qualifies as extreme epic. News – People love news and this feels like news. Curiosity – This makes you wonder what the snake is and how big it is. Plus, it’s a little counterintuitive because this audience knows that there are no snakes bigger than Titanoboa."
"Don’t Eat Canned Sardines Until You Watch This","Don’t (Activity) Until You Watch This","+2426","Negativity – Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing the audience’s attention. Curiosity – This is a major cliffhanger and makes you wonder what’s wrong with canned sardines. Urgency – If you eat sardines, there’s some urgency here to watch this before you eat your next can."
"The Reading Method That Changed My Language Learning","The (Action) Method That Changed My (Desired skill)","+2640","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to change their language learning.

It makes you wonder what this method is."
"Leonardo da Vinci: The Renaissance Genius Who Changed the World","(Person): The (Specific description) Who (Epic action)","+5226","Epic – Phrases like “Renaissance Genius” and “Changed the World” make this video feel exciting and epic."
"My MASSIVE Reptile Enclosure has 23 Animals Preparing for a STORM!","","-74","The #1 rule of writing YouTube titles: be clear, not clever. This title violates that rule. This video is about “the coolest jungle enclosure you’ve ever seen” (according to the intro). Making the title about animals preparing for a storm is just trying to be too clever. If it were me, I’d make the title about how this is the coolest reptile enclosure you’ve ever seen. And I’d probably use the word “reptile” and not “jungle,” because reptiles are the reason people watch this channel. Now, you could ask if making a video about jungle enclosures was even a good idea in the first place, considering people watch this channel to learn about reptiles, but that’s a conversation for another email.

"Beware of The HUGE Medicare Penalty for Selling Your Home After 63","Beware of The HUGE (Problem) for (Activity)","+854","Negativity – Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing the audience’s attention. Specific Audience – Calling out a large, but specific audience, like people selling their home after 63, can work well because it makes them feel like you made the video specifically for them."
"The ONLY way to become fluent in ENGLISH","The ONLY way to (Achieve Goal)","+1331","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to be fluent in English. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know which way he’s talking about. Constraint – The constraint of the “ONLY way” makes this video so much more challenging and interesting."
"Something Strange is Happening in China","Something Strange is Happening in (Entity)","+1339","Curiosity – This simple title builds curiosity two ways: Talking about “strange” things builds curiosity.



It opens a loop and makes you wonder what exactly is happening."
"I’m 52 But Feel 32—This Is the Lunch I Eat Every Day","I’m (Actual state) But Feel (Better state)—This Is the (Entity) I (Activity) Every Day","+1616","Desire – Most 52-year-olds would love to feel 32. Plus, they’d love to know which lunch can help them achieve that. Credibility – This one might be a bit of a stretch because it’s not exactly verifiable, but by claiming he feels 32, it makes him sound more credible, so you’re more interested in his opinion and habits. Contrast – The contrast between “I’m 52” and “Feel 32” builds interest and curiosity here. Daily – Talking about things you do every day makes the video feel more tangible and interesting. Specific – This isn’t about vague health tips, this is about something specific: the lunch he eats every day."
"Is Waymo About to Dethrone Uber?","","-83","This is a good title. In fact, it’s so good that a video by this channel using the same exact format got 405K views: “Is Chipotle About to Dethrone McDonald’s?” So why did this one flop, but the Chipotle video went viral? Here’s my best guess: most of us love Chipotle. We read that title and think, “Yes! Go Chipotle!” and then watch the video to see how they’re going to dethrone McDonald’s. But do people feel the same way about Waymo? Would you describe yourself as being on Team Waymo? Maybe I’m just a simple Florida man, but I don’t think so. And since nobody has strong emotions about Waymo, this title just doesn’t excite you as much as the Chipotle video. So, how else could we title this video? Well, we might not need to use Waymo in the title. We might be better off using an easily understood label instead and adding some more drama: “This Small Startup Is About To Ruin Uber” (Yes, I know Waymo isn’t small, but compared to Uber it is. We could also leave out the “small” if we wanted.) Or, we could focus the title wholly on Uber: “Uber Is About To Collapse” The lesson: modeling proven formats is the best way to come up with great video ideas, but ideally, you know exactly why the original video did so well, and your idea matches those conditions. Oh, and have a few backup titles just in case. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The 20 BIGGEST Cheating Scandals in Golf History","The 20 BIGGEST Cheating Scandals in (Niche) History","+446","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – People can’t get enough of controversial things like cheating scandals. Extreme & Epic – “BIGGEST” and “in Golf History” make this video feel extreme, epic, and interesting."
"How we KILLED the Greatest Kind of Vehicle","How we KILLED the Greatest (Entity)","+449","Negativity – Killing something great brings some interesting conflict here. Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: It’s counterintuitive – why would you kill something great?



It opens a loop and makes you want to know why and how we did this."
"10 Things to NEVER HAVE In Your Home When Selling","10 Things to NEVER (Activity) When (Activity)","+1661","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Warnings like this do a great job at getting people’s attention and getting them to click."
"HOW Youtube Changed My Life (in 4 months) | My Journey to Full-Time Creator","HOW [Entity] Changed My Life (in [Short time frame]) | My Journey to [Desired end goal]","+2448","Desire – This creator’s audience would love for YouTube to change their lives and to be a full-time creator. Time Frame – The time frame of 4 months adds to the desire (it’s a relatively short time to have your life changed) and it makes this video feel more tangible, real and interesting. Curiosity – This opens a loop and builds two questions in the audience’s mind: How did his life change?



How did YouTube change his life?"
"Back on Icon (Episode 558)","","-99","This is a particular pet peeve of mine: posting podcast episodes on your non-podcast channel. YouTube wants you to binge watch channels, but when you post different formats (i.e. vlogs, podcasts, video essays, talking head listicles, etc), it makes that a lot harder for the viewers. The best channels, like MrBeast, Diary of a CEO, all post one format. I’m not saying you can’t publish multiple formats on your channel, I’m just saying success on YouTube will typically come a lot easier if you don’t. And not to mention, this title could be a lot better. Instead of focusing the title on the creators, I’d focus it on the most interesting part of the video.

"The Most Hated Eating Channel on TikTok","The Most Hated (Entity)","+533","Negativity – This title is full of drama and controversy, which people love. Curiosity – Instead of saying the channel name, this title gives it an extreme, unique label: “The Most Hated Eating Channel on TikTok”. This makes this title easy to understand and also makes you wonder what the channel is."
"Why Everything in Retirement Changes If You Have a Pension","Why Everything in (Activity) Changes If You (Specific Situation)","+563","Curiosity – This builds curiosity and makes you wonder what changes. Specific Audience – Calling out people in a specific situation is a great way to grab their attention and get them to watch your video. Epic – Saying “Everything” changes, instead of just “Things,” makes this video feel more epic and interesting."
"This is Why 99% of Amateurs Don’t Create Clubhead Speed!","This is Why 99% of Amateurs Don’t (Desired activity)!","+4195","Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder why amateurs don’t create clubhead speed. Beginners – Calling out beginners (or amateurs, in this case) is a great way to make a large segment of the audience feel like you made your video specifically for them. Desire – This creator’s audience would love more clubhead speed. Negativity – There’s a bit of FOMO here because if you’re an amateur golfer, you feel like you’re missing out on clubhead speed."
"What Happens to NEW Cars That Never Sell? Behind the Dealer Lot!","What Happens to NEW (Entities) That Never (Activity)?","+9461","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity in three ways: It asks a question.



It’s a little counterintuitive — why would new cars never sell?



“Behind the Dealer Lot” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. You could also say that “Behind the Dealer Lot” brings in a little credibility because it feels like you’re getting this information from a credible source, but I’d guess the curiosity is what really made this title successful."
"The Cost of Letting Go, Why Retirement After 60 Is SO Hard","","-88","I think this title flopped for two reasons. First, it’s too vague. “The Cost of Letting Go” isn’t specific or clear enough to grab the audience’s attention, tell them what the video is about, and get them to click. And second, it’s too complicated. I think it’d probably do better if it was just “Why Retirement After 60 Is SO Hard”. Having the extra words at the beginning of the title makes it harder to read and waters down its punchiness. The lesson? Write short, clear, punchy, emotional titles for your videos.

"We Cancelled Our Cruise Seconds Before Boarding","We Cancelled Our (Entity) Seconds Before (Starting)","+494","Negativity – People love drama, like cancelling things. Time Frame – The time frame of “seconds before boarding” amplifies the drama. Curiosity – This starts a story, but doesn’t finish it, so you have to click and watch the video to find out why."
"50mm & The Biggest Mistake You’re Making","(Entity) & The Biggest Mistake You’re Making","+620","Negativity – Nobody wants to make a mistake, so mistakes make for great topics. Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it’s about the biggest mistake (which makes it extreme and unique), plus it’s only about one mistake, which makes it more specific and interesting."
"Priest Ranks Worst Addictions","(Authority Figure) Ranks Worst (Entities)","+827","Authority – A priest is someone whose opinion many people value. Curiosity – People love to see how different things rank and compare to each other. Negativity – Controversial things like bad addictions make for interesting topics."
"Do This Once & Watch How People Treat You Differently","Do This Once & (Observe result)","+969","Curiosity – This builds curiosity 3 ways: It makes you wonder what “this” is.



It makes you wonder how people will treat you differently.



It’s counterintuitive that doing something once will have such a big impact. Desire – This creator’s audience wants people to treat them differently, and this difference is assumed to be a good change. Plus, it says you only have to do it once, which adds even more to the desire. It feels like you’re getting a lot for a little."
"They Don’t Want You To Know This Secret","","-92","This title seems good, but I think it’s too vague. When you’re trying to build curiosity in your audience’s mind, you need to be in the middle between these two options: “I have no idea what this is about, I don’t care”



“I know exactly what this is about, I don’t care” This title falls too close to the first option. Neither the thumbnail nor the title gives you any information or context for what this video is about, so it’s not that compelling. Although the above title (“Do This Once & Watch How People Treat You Differently”) from the same channel is also vague, it does give you two details that make it more interesting: It tells you how often to do “this” (once)



It tells you what the result will be (people will treat you differently) If I were rewriting this title, I’d give more context about what the secret is, who “they” are, or what the stakes or impact of the secret is.

"Convert ANY Cargo Trailer into a CAMPER in 1 DAY (start-to-finish)","[Achieve a goal] in [Short time frame] (start-to-finish)","+485","Desire – This creator’s audience is into converting cargo trailers to campers. Time frame & Constraint – The short time frame of 1 day makes this title more tangible, challenging, desirable, and interesting. Epic & Completeness – “ANY” and “(start-to-finish)” gives this video a feeling that it’s epic and complete."
"I Paid Bakeries $5000 To Recreate AI Cakes!","I Paid (Service providers) (Lots of money) To Recreate AI (Entities)!","+520","There’s just something interesting about seeing online or AI-created stuff come to real life. Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: It opens a loop because you can’t wait to see how it turns out.



There’s contrast between AI and real life. Authority – The fact that bakeries (not just the creator) are recreating these ai cakes makes this feel more legit."
"Every Daily Habit That Destroys Your Brain Explained in 10 Minutes","Every (Action) That (Unwanted result) Explained in 10 Minutes","+912","Negativity – Nobody wants to destroy their brain. Tangible – Titles that are specific and tangible often do well because the viewer can easily envision what the video will be about (which makes them want to watch it more). This title has two phrases in particular that make it tangible: “Daily” – Habits make for powerful topics, but “daily” makes these habits even more specific and attention-grabbing.



“10 Minutes” – the time frame of 10 minutes makes it even more tangible. The relatively short time frame also adds a constraint, which makes it seem more challenging and interesting, and makes it more desirable because you feel like you’re getting a lot for a little. Relatability – The thumbnail grabs attention because most of us do at least one of these habits. Epic – The word “Every” makes this video feel more epic and complete."
"why do some things just look so good?","why do some (Entities) just (Action) so good?","+2391","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a big question many people have asked themselves at some time."
"How Airport Thieves Pick Their Victims (Avoid These Mistakes!)","How [Unwanted Things Happen] (Avoid These Mistakes!)","+501","Negativity – This leverages negativity to grab your attention two ways: It’s about thieves and victims.



It’s about avoiding mistakes. This title is also effective because it’s subtly persuasive. It’s not trying to convince you to follow these tips to avoid getting robbed. It’s about what the thieves do, then you can choose for yourself to avoid those mistakes."
"You’re in a War (and You Don’t Even Know It) | Eric Weinstein [ARC 2025]","You’re in a [Bad situation] (and You Don’t Even Know It)","+2657","Negativity – Being told you’re in a war grabs your attention, and not even knowing it doubles up on that ominous feeling. Curiosity – “(and You Don’t Even Know It)” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret."
"5 Morning Habits That MELT Belly Fat","5 (Specific time) Habits That (Achieve Goal)","+6563","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to melt their belly fat. Negativity – This isn’t about habits to get a 6-pack (desire), this is about habits to melt belly fat (pain point). Specific – Making this video specifically about “morning” habits makes this more specific, tangible, and interesting."
"I tested Suit vs No Suit — Do people treat you differently?","I tested (Option A) vs (Option B) — (Is there a different outcome?)","+26000","Credibility – Experiments like this are more persuasive and credible because the creator actually went out and did something (they’re not just preaching their opinion). Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: It asks a question.



There’s contrast between suit and no suit."
"10 DEADLY Travel Mistakes NOBODY Is Talking About","","-89","This title follows a proven format, but I think there’s one problem with it: it’s too broad. There are three ways this might’ve done better by being more specific: #1: More specific topic Looking at some of his recent successful videos, I wonder if this would’ve gotten more views if he decided to focus on airport or hotel mistakes instead of general travel mistakes. #2: More specific title Even if he kept the same topic, it might help to write the title around one specific mistake. For example, “Why I’ll Never Rent A Scooter In Southeast Asia Again.” When I make list videos like this, I typically have a few specific titles about a single topic from the video and a few broad list titles to test out. #3: More specific thumbnail Just like writing the title about one specific point, it could also be worth making the thumbnail about one specific point. Something like, “Never Do This In Mexico,” and the thumbnail image is doing something many people like to do in Mexico. In summary, you might consider testing broad vs. narrow titles on your channel to see what resonates best with your audience. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"How I Took Notes in High School (to get STRAIGHT As)","How I [Activity] ([Proof of credibility])","+552","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn how to take better notes and get straight As. Credibility – This creator proves why she’s worth listening to by mentioning that she got straight As."
"8 things I did to stop wasting my evenings after work","8 things I did to stop (Making specific mistake)","+877","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This is about moving away from pain — stopping wasting evenings — as opposed to moving towards pleasure, like being more productive in the evenings."
"15 FORGOTTEN Vegetables Your Grandparents Grew That NEED to Come Back","15 FORGOTTEN (Entities) (Old, respected group) (Activity) That NEED to Come Back","+2429","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Nostalgia – “FORGOTTEN Vegetables Your Grandparents Grew” leverages nostalgia to get you emotionally invested in this video. Curiosity – “FORGOTTEN” adds a little mystery to this title."
"When Helping An Upset Child, Don’t Talk & Try This Instead","When (Solving a problem), Don’t (Logical activity) & Try This Instead","+18","Negativity – This is all about solving a problem. Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: It’s counterintuitive because many people might think it’s best to talk.



It opens a loop because it makes you want to know what “this” is. Editor’s picky note: if I was writing this title I’d use “but” instead of “&” because typically “but” adds more conflict and tension than “and,” which makes for a better title."
"5 Makeup Tricks To Look Younger Instantly","5 (Activity) Tricks To (Achieve goal) Instantly","+444","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience loves tricks to look younger. Speed – People love speed and “instantly” adds to the desire here."
"12 Brutal Truths About Women That Men LEARN Too Late!","12 Brutal Truths About (Entity) That (Audience) LEARN Too Late!","+853","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Urgency – Saying men learn these “Too Late” adds a little urgency for you to watch this right now. Negativity – “Brutal” adds some drama and controversy here."
"how i use free AI to create viral UGC tiktok ads.","how i use free (Entity) to (Achieve goal).","+994","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to make viral tiktok ads. Free – Everybody loves free stuff, which adds to the desire. This whole title is about getting a lot (viral ads) for a little (using free AI)."
"How this animation got me a job","How this (Entity) (Helped me achieve a goal)","+3073","Curiosity – This makes you want to see the animation. Desire – Some people in this creator’s audience are looking for jobs or gigs. And there’s outside validation that this animation was really cool. It wasn’t just that he thought it was cool — somebody else thought it was so good they offered him a job."
"The ONLY Ecommerce Email Marketing Guide You’ll Need","","-94","There are a few reasons why this might have flopped: In the last year or so, this is the only video with “email marketing” in the title. It might not be the best topic for his channel.



It might be too far down in the funnel. Optimizing your email marketing has a lot less of a potential audience than, say, finding products to drop ship.



It might not be compelling enough. I love using “ONLY” in titles, but it’s possible the title just isn’t sexy enough. Now the first two reasons this might’ve flopped are about the topic, but there’s not much we can do about that now that the video is already published. So let’s brainstorm some ideas to make the title more compelling. We could add a benefit: “Copy This Email Marketing Sequence To Blow Up Your Ecom Store In 2025” We could add some FOMO: “The $1,000,000 Ecommerce Email Strategy You’re Probably Not Using” Or we could add more curiosity and be a little more broadly appealing and vague: “The Simplest Strategy To 10X Your Ecom Store” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"I did Duolingo for 2000 days. Can I speak Spanish?","I did (Activity that people assume works) for (Long time frame). Can I (Achieve Goal)?","+1115","Credibility – This isn’t just a review of Duolingo. He shows that he’s used it for a long time, which makes this video more trustworthy. Time Frame – The long time frame of 2,000 days provides credibility and makes this video feel more tangible and specific. Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question."
"How to Get Rich in the New Era of A.I. (2025)","How to [Achieve Goal] in the New Era of [Trend]. ([Current or upcoming year])","+1414","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to get rich in the AI era. Timeliness – This leverages timeliness in two ways: It’s about a trending topic — AI.



It was published in the beginning of the year and drops in the current year to let you know this is relevant right now. New – People love new things, like “the New Era of A.I.” here."
"Priest Answers: If Someone Confesses A Murder, What Do You Do?","(Authority Figure) Answers: If (Difficult situation), What Do You Do?","+1571","Authority – This title leverages authority by dropping “Priest Answers” right in the front. Negativity – People love controversial and conflicting topics like this. Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question."
"5 things I wish I knew before I started watercolor","5 things I wish I knew before I started (Activity)","+1910","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Regret – Regrets like this make for great video topics because they’re such common, powerful emotions."
"Donating PetSmart Toys to a Cat Cafe","","-92","This is a nice title, but it’s too bland and boring. There’s no drama, curiosity or any strong emotion to make you click. Here are some alternate titles that could’ve been more emotional: “Cats React To The Weirdest New Petsmart Toys” “Homeless Cats React To New Petsmart Toys” “I Donated Every Petsmart Cat Toy To A Cat Cafe” “10 Minutes of Homeless Cats Playing With New Toys” Now all these titles may not necessarily fit this video, but that’s why it’s so important to come up with a clickable title BEFORE you make a video. To avoid a flop like this, make sure your title is emotional enough to get people to click. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Why the Doberman Crushes Every Other Dog Breed","Why (Entity) (Action) Every Other (Entity category)","+945","Extreme – Bold, extreme statements like this often make for great titles on YouTube. Curiosity – Starting this title with “Why” is a simple way to add a little curiosity. Controversial – Some people would disagree with this statement, which often makes for a great YouTube title."
"if you’ve never been in a relationship, watch this (2025)","if you [Are in an undesirable state], watch this ([Current year])","+1660","Negativity & Specific – Calling out a group of people with a specific pain point (like people who’ve never been in a relationship) is a great way to grab your ideal audience’s attention. Timeliness – This video was published at the end of 2024 when 2025 was on everybody’s mind, so dropping “(2025)” at the end of the title also grabs the audience’s attention. Curiosity – “watch this” builds curiosity because it’s vague and open-ended."
"They Said It Couldn’t Be Done… But I Built This DIY Fireplace Anyway!","They Said It Couldn’t Be Done… But I (Action) Anyway!","+2063","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to build a DIY fireplace. Curiosity – There’s a bit of contrast and conflict between “they said it couldn’t be done” and “I built this anyway” that makes you wonder how they did it."
"The REALITY of Tech Jobs in 2025","The REALITY of (Polarizing entity) in (Current or upcoming year)","+8465","Timeliness – This video is about a trending topic, but they double down on that by dropping in the current year to let you know this is about what’s going on right now. Negativity – Since tech jobs are struggling right now, this is a controversial topic that grabs lots of attention. Curiosity – This title is vague and open-ended, which makes you want to know what’s going on with tech jobs."
"i read 365 self help books, these are the best ones","","-97","I think this is a great title, so why did it flop? Well, it’s possible this creator’s audience doesn’t like the term “self help” books. Or maybe “these are best ones” just isn’t spicy or specific enough. Here are some alternate titles she could try: “5 Underrated Books That Will Change Your Life” “i read 365 books, these 5 will change your life” “if you’re feeling stuck in life, read these books (2025)” But maybe her audience just isn’t interested in a list of books that could change their life, or the thumbnail wasn’t quite compelling enough, or there was something wrong with the content that turned viewers off. Sometimes good videos, titles and thumbnails miss the mark for some combination of reasons we don’t understand. Alright, enough armchair titling, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Texas Judge Can’t Believe What Was Said In His Courtroom","(Person) Can’t Believe (Vague, open-ended action)","+498","Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what was said. Negativity – Since this title says this video takes place in a courtroom, there’s some expected drama here."
"What Actually Is Blue Raspberry?","What Actually Is (Commonly known, but slightly mysterious entity)?","+610","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question about something that everybody knows of, but nobody actually knows about."
"8 Vaseline Hacks That Will Change Your Life | Dermatologist Tips","8 (Specific tool) Hacks That Will Change Your Life","+1387","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience is into hacks that can change their life. Curiosity – Vaseline is a pretty common, basic item, so the fact that hacks with it can “change your life” builds curiosity because of the contrast and counterintuitiveness. Broadly appealing – Almost everybody has Vaseline lying around the house somewhere, so this is relevant for a large potential audience."
"Top 20 New Technology Trends That Will Define the Future","Top 20 New (Niche) Trends That Will Define the Future","+6572","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – An easy way to build curiosity is to talk about the future. Desire – This creator’s audience is into technology trends. “New” – Everybody loves new things."
"How A Domino’s Pizza Mascot Caused A Hostage Situation","","-78","There are two main reasons I think this flopped: The first is that it’s a complicated title. Specifically, “Domino’s Pizza Mascot” makes for a long and confusing subject. Compare this to the other video from this channel we featured earlier: “What Actually Is Blue Raspberry?” The subject “Blue Raspberry” is much simpler and easier to understand. Could they have just used, “Domino’s Mascot”? That might’ve been better. But there’s a bigger reason I think this flopped: it’s about a hostage situation. The audience watches this channel for food videos, not true crime videos. Even though this is technically about a food chain, the main story is still a crime story. To avoid these mistakes: Make sure your titles are simple and easy to read.



Know why your audience watches your videos and deliver on that premise in each video. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Is singing dead?","Is (Common, popular, or ever-present thing) dead?","+460","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a simple, yet powerful question. It’s also counterintuitive that singing would be dead because it’s such a staple in human history. Negativity – People love to watch videos about controversial takes like this."
"The Shortest NBA Player Is Doing The Impossible","The (Underdog) Is Doing The Impossible","+1344","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity 2 ways: It’s counterintuitive — you wouldn’t expect the shortest NBA player to be doing anything remarkable.



It opens a loop. What is “the impossible”? What’s he actually doing? Epic – “Doing The Impossible” makes this video feel epic and exciting. Extreme – This isn’t about “A Short NBA Player,” it’s about “The Shortest NBA Player.” This title, being extreme, makes the video clearer and more interesting."
"The 4 Methods People Use to Get Rich with Real Estate","The 4 Methods People Use to (Achieve goal) with (Specific opportunity)","+2130","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This channel’s audience would love to get rich with real estate. “Method” – My guess is that “ways”, “tips”, etc. are a little played out, but “methods” is a new way of saying the same thing we know works."
"The Most Insane Camera Ever Made.","The Most Insane (Entity) Ever (Action).","+9752","Epic & Extreme – “The Most Insane” and “Ever Made” both make this video feel epic, extreme, and awesome. And I normally don’t like using periods at the end of titles, but in this case, it adds to the epicness by giving this statement an “End of discussion” feeling. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn about amazing cameras."
"Some videos LOOK live, but they’re not meant as such. So for requests, double check!","","-93","Can you tell me in one second exactly what this video is about? No. Let’s look at the title from this channel we mentioned earlier in this email: “Is singing dead?” Can you tell me in one second exactly what this video is about? Yes! And to make things even worse, I watched the first minute of this video and still couldn’t tell you what it was about. So to avoid a flop like this, make sure your title is simple and clear, and in your intro reassure the audience that they’re watching the right video.

"How I Became a Millionaire on a 9-5 Salary","How I (Achieved Goal) (With Unexpected Constraint)","+702","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to become millionaires. Refute Objection – Many people might think “You can’t become a millionaire on a 9-5 salary, you have to start a big business or do some shady stuff.” This title refutes that objection. Constraint – Similar to the point above, people might think being on a 9-5 salary is a constraint to becoming a millionaire, which makes this video way more interesting. Resonates with the audience – The audience is probably on a 9-5 salary, they want to become millionaires, but they don’t have much, so the thumbnail text and title both resonate with the audience."
"17 WORST Cars That NO ONE Buys According to Consumer Reports","17 WORST (Entities) That NO ONE (Action) According to (Authority)","+951","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – People love drama and controversy like this. Plus, this sparks the fearful question, “Is my car on this list?” Authority – This leverages the authority of Consumer Reports to be more credible."
"Hitler’s Last Secrets Revealed in Unpublished Archives","(Authority Figure’s) Last (Possession) Revealed in (Secretive source)","+3696","Curiosity – This leverages curiosity in two ways: “Last Secrets Revealed” uses secrecy to build curiosity.



“Unpublished Archives” also makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret because these archives were “unpublished.” Authority – This leverages the name recognition and notoriety of Hitler. Scarcity – The fact that these are his last secrets makes them feel unique and scarce, which makes this video feel more interesting."
"What Real Estate Agents DON’T Tell You About Living In Maine","What (Authority Figures) DON’T Tell You About (Activity)","+3806","Curiosity & Negativity- “What they DON’T tell you” gives you FOMO and makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Authority – This leverages the authority of Real Estate Agents."
"13 DEADLY Mistakes Manual Drivers Make (that Kills Your Car)","","-99","Here’s a quick story: I had a dog channel a while ago and made a video for puppy owners. It flopped horribly, even though it was a good title and good content. I’m pretty sure this happened because it was such a small segment of the audience. And I think this is the same issue here. It’s a good title, but manual drivers are such a small segment of this channel’s audience that it just didn’t quite get off the ground. It’s great to make videos for specific segments of your audience sometimes, but know that if the segment is too small it can also result in a flop like this or my puppy video.

"New Pickleball Rules for 2025 (MUST KNOW)","New [Entities] for [Upcoming Year] (MUST KNOW)","+490","Timeliness – This video was published at the end of 2024 when 2025 was on everybody’s mind.

"How Did the Average American Live in Every Decade?","How Did the Average (Entity) (Activity) in Every (Time Period)?","+572","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question. “Every” – The word “every” gives this video a feeling of epicness and completeness."
"Give Me 9 Minutes, and 2025 Will Be Your Best Year Yet","Give Me (Time Frame), and (You’ll Achieve Goal)","+1322","Time Frame – The time frame of “9 minutes” makes this video feel more tangible and interesting. Timeliness – This was published at the end of 2024 when everybody was excited about the upcoming year. It’s a time when people are planning for and getting excited about the future. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to have their best year yet. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity because it promises a big benefit, but is vague about what you’ll get from watching this video and how you’ll get it."
"Bought 22 Rental Units and Now I Regret It. Here’s Why…","(Aspirational Action) and Now I Regret It. Here’s Why…","+19901","Credibility – This isn’t just theory — she actually bought 22 rental units, which answers the question, “why should I listen to you?” Negativity – Regret is such a powerful negative emotion people want to avoid, so this grabs attention. Curiosity – “Here’s Why…” adds some curiosity at the end and makes you want to know why."
"What Happened to the Merrill Lynch Mansion?","","-72","If you want to build curiosity, there’s a sweet spot you gotta land in: your audience needs to have some idea of what you’re talking about to be interested, but not know too much that they already know the answer. In this case, I’d assume most people have no idea what happened to the Merrill Lynch mansion or know anything about it, so their curiosity isn’t piqued enough. This title might work if it was about something more familiar, like the first White House, but obviously that’s not the case. So instead, I’d try to make this title about something more familiar or easily understandable, like: “The Most Insane Mansion In Southampton” or “Inside This $40,000,000 New York Mansion” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

what will change?



will I like the change?"
"20 Celebrities You Didn’t Know Were On The Andy Griffith Show","20 (Attractive or interesting entities) You Didn’t Know (Action)","+1169","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – “You Didn’t Know” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Interest – This creator’s audience is interested in celebrities and the Andy Griffith Show, which gets them excited about this video."
"Why living in Canada has become Impossible","Why (Common thing) has become Impossible","+1189","Negativity – This is all about a problem and controversy, which grabs people’s attention. Confirms Suspicions – Some people are already thinking this to themselves, so this title resonates with that feeling."
"The Best 25 Minute Exercise Routine For Seniors Over 60","The Best (Time frame) (Action) For (Specific audience)","+1702","Desire – This creator’s audience wants exercise routines. Time Frame – Specifying this exercise routine is 25 minutes makes this video more tangible and desirable. Specific Audience – Calling out “Seniors Over 60” makes it clear who this video is for and makes them more likely to click."
"Optimal Order Of Investing For Self-Employed","","-80","The best YouTube titles are clear and bold. “Optimal” isn’t very clear or bold. A more clear, bold way to put it could be: “The Best Order Of Investing For Self-Employed.” It’s also possible this just isn’t a very exciting angle. We could add some more curiosity and excitement into this title like this: “Invest In This First If You’re Self-Employed” This title narrows the focus to just one thing thing to invest in first which makes it both more clear and more intriguing. Lesson: write clear, bold titles about exciting topics. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Why do Studios Ignore Blender?","Why do (Authority figures) Ignore (Popular solution)?","+630","Authority – “Studios” are big authority figures in the VFX world. Negativity – This is about drama and controversy — studios ignoring a popular software. Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question."
"Valorant just got the CRAZIEST Update in History!","(Entity) just got the CRAZIEST Update in History!","+684","News – This title is news and people love news. Epic & Extreme – “CRAZIEST Update in History” feels epic, extreme, and exciting. Curiosity – This also builds curiosity because it makes you want to know what the update is."
"What staying up all night does to your brain – Anna Rothschild","What (Common, innocent mistake) does to your (Possession)","+811","Negativity – This hints that something many people do might be causing a problem. Tangible – “What staying up all night does to your brain” feels more tangible and specific than just, “What staying up all night does to you.” This builds more curiosity and makes this title more interesting."
"If You FEEL Time Slips Away, Watch This!","If You (Experience Problem), Watch This!","+9851","Negativity – This is about a problem many people have. Curiosity – This implies that this video is a solution for people who feel time slips away, but doesn’t say anything about the actual solution, so you’ve gotta click to see what it is. Being vague like this can backfire, but the thumbnail text mentions a benefit and the problem presented in the tile (feeling time slip away) is such a common and tangible problem that this title gets away with it."
"Why Tutankhamun’s Tomb Is The Biggest Discovery Of All Time","","-91","I like this title — “biggest discovery of all time” is an exciting promise. But apparently the audience didn’t like it. Now it could’ve been because everyone knows him as “King Tut” and not “Tutankhamun.” If it were me, I would’ve gone with his nickname instead of his full name. But since they used “King Tut” in the thumbnail, I don’t think that’s the main reason this video flopped. It was probably because the topic or angle didn’t resonate. And since we’re stuck with the topic, let’s try some different angles. We could try to zoom in on a specific detail: “This Tiny Box In King Tut’s Tomb Is The Biggest Discovery Of All Time” We could zoom out and make it more easily understandable and broadly appealing: “This Ancient Egyptian Tomb Is The Biggest Discovery Of All Time” Or we could try to add more curiosity: “This Ancient Egyptian Tomb Changes Everything We Know About History” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Could this new material replace plastic?","Could this new (Entity) replace (Existing, problematic entity)?","+516","New – People love new things. Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question."
"I Tried a 1-Star Cruise","I Tried a (Poorly-rated entity)","+588","Negativity & Curiosity – The tension of trying a 1-star thing is so intriguing because people want to see what happened and how bad it turned out."
"You’re Not Behind: Why Everyone SEEMS To Have More Money Than You","You’re Not (Undesirable State): Why Everyone SEEMS To (Be in a better position) Than You","+738","Negativity – This is all about a pain point: feeling like everyone has more money than you. Status – This is also about your status and how wealthy you are compared to everyone else."
"If You’re Creative But Lazy Please Watch This","If You’re (Positive Attribute) But (Undesirable Attribute) Please Watch This","+2072","Specific Audience – If you identify as creative, but lazy (which is a lot of us), this title makes you feel like this video was made specifically for you, so you’re more likely to watch it. Negativity – Most people don’t want to be lazy, so this calls out a pain point and grabs your attention. Curiosity – This title is a cliffhanger. You know who it’s for and what problem it addresses, but nothing else, which piques your curiosity."
"WARNING: AI Is Stealing People’s Homes","","-83","I really like the way this title is written, so why did it flop? My guess is that it’s not very believable. I’m writing this on my couch and having a really hard time imagining AI busting down my door and stealing my home from me. My house is just too tangible and I don’t think it’s going anywhere (although Hurricane Milton tried last year). I’m not saying the content in the video isn’t true, I’m saying just by reading the title I have a hard time imagining it to be. Now if this was about AI stealing my identity, bank account, or even people’s teslas out of their driveways, that’d be more believable because you can easily envision that happening. So the next time you’re deciding whether or not to make a video ask yourself: is this topic believable? Can people imagine how it would happen? Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The future of social media | 2025 trends you NEED to know","The future of (Niche) | (Upcoming or current year) trends you NEED to know","+1080","Curiosity & Desire – Everybody wants to know what the future holds, but nobody actually knows, so the future is such a great topic because its full of curiosity and desire.

It’s tangible and aspirational, so talking about doing things every day can be great to use in titles."
"Why Studying Less will Give You an UNFAIR ADVANTAGE","Why (Counterintuitive Statement)","+3443","Curiosity – This is counterintuitive. How can studying less give you an advantage? Desire – This leverages desire in two ways: Everybody would love to study less.



Everybody wants an unfair advantage."
"A Mother Forgives and “ADOPTS” Her Son’s MURDERER… (True Story)","","-95","Here are some of the most-viewed titles on this channel: If You Hear a Pastor SKIP This Verse… RUN!! (Here’s What They Are Hiding)



They “REMOVED” This Verse From The Bible!! (WHY??)



Pastors Want This Video BANNED!! (You’ll See Why) Two things are clear from these titles: The videos are about Christianity



The videos are educational This title doesn’t meet either of those criteria. It’s a story and doesn’t say anything about Christianity, which is probably a big part of why it didn’t get as many views as most of the other videos on this channel. Two things he could do: First, make it clear that this video is about a Christian to attract the right audience: “Christian Woman Forgives and “ADOPTS” Her Son’s MURDERER… (True Story)” (Note that we’re using a keyword not to let the algorithm know what this video is about, but to let the audience know.) The other option is to spin it in an educational way: “The Bible Verse That Let This Woman Forgive and “ADOPT” Her Son’s MURDERER” To avoid a flop like this on your channel, know why people watch your channel and deliver on that premise in each video.

Status – This is about status: are you a winner or loser? Timeliness – This video was published at the end of 2024 when 2025 was on everybody’s mind. Desire – This creator’s audience loves AI and wants to get better at using it."
"Psychopathic Stalker Goes Before the Wrong Judge","(Polarizing Entity) (Action) the Wrong (Entity)","+1478","Curiosity – This title does a great job of starting a story to grab your attention. It’s a cliffhanger that uses tension and almost forces you to click because you’ve got to see what happens. Negativity – “Psychopathic Stalker” and “Wrong Judge” bring some drama and conflict to get you interested in this video."
"A notebook to replace doomscrolling","A (Object) to replace (Problem)","+8320","Negativity – “doomscrolling” is a problem that many people in this audience resonate with. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to stop doomscrolling by using something more wholesome, like this notebook."
"Judge DiSanto Calls This Court Case Her “Daily Disaster”","","-92","People make this mistake all the time: using proper names at the wrong time. Unless the person’s name is a household name, like Elon Musk or LeBron James, it’s often better to use their position, like judge, NBA player, etc. This is because if people don’t immediately recognize the name, that may cause them to not be interested in the video. On the other hand, everybody will immediately recognize “judge.” On top of that, it seems like the audience isn’t really into this angle. Here are a few other angles: “This Court Case Ruined This Judge’s Life” This adds a bit more drama and may be too hyperbolic, but people do love drama. “Drunk Defendant Accidentally Makes His Case A Lot Worse” Again adding more drama here, but it’s also a bit more interesting because it gives more detail about the defendant, as opposed to the vague, “daily disaster”. If your initial angle isn’t working, switch it up and try something new, don’t just make tiny little changes. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Tech that Died in 2024","(Entities) that Died in (Year that just ended)","+1868","Negativity – This isn’t about the best tech of 2024. It’s about tech that died, and people love drama like this. Timeliness – This video was published at the end of 2024, so it’s relevant right now. Curiosity – This makes you wonder what this tech is."
"It’s Time To Take Your Dreams Seriously – The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho","","-88","This title isn’t punchy or tangible enough. “It’s Time To Take Your Dreams Seriously” is just a little too fluffy. Here are some of the other titles she tried: It’s Time To Take Your Dreams Seriously



Dreams Showdown: Following Your Heart vs Playing It Safe



Take your dreams seriously before it’s too late. These are all about a similar angle: taking your dreams seriously. If your video isn’t doing as well as you hoped, it’s often best to totally switch up the angle. Here are some options: “Quit Putting Your Dreams On Pause” Similar message, but it’s a warning that brings a bit more drama. “Stop Letting Life Pass You By” Similar to the “quit” title above, but this is a slightly different way to tap into the audience’s biggest fears and frustrations. “Read This Book To Make 2025 Your Best Year Ever” New angle that talks about the benefits of this book and brings some timeliness into it. Lesson: if a video didn’t do well, come up with titles from new angles that bring more curiosity, fear, or desire. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

“Giving her distance is your superpower” 120K views “6 things your (introvert) woman needs you to understand about dating her” is kind of about the audience, but more about their woman. And although the audience cares about their woman, they care about themselves more. Not to mention, the fact that this is about dating introverted women narrows the audience a bit (which isn’t necessarily bad), but the audience needs to think for a second — is my woman an introvert? If I were to rewrite this title, I’d try to make it more about the audience: “If You’re Dating An Introvert You Need To Know THIS” or “6 Things You NEED To Know If You’re Dating An Introvert” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

“Changing” is also open-ended. What’s changing about it? Negativity – There’s a hint of controversy here since typically people don’t like supplements changing their sport, and the thumbnail text in red supports the thought that this is a negative change."
"When Tennis turns into WAR! (Federer vs Medvedev)","When [Entity] turns into WAR! ([Authority Figure] vs [Authority Figure])","+889","Epic – Describing a tennis match as turning into “WAR” makes this feel way more epic and exciting. Negativity – This title brings a lot of conflict, which people love. Authority – Federer and Medvedev grab attention here because they’re both popular tennis players."
"10 things people with Clean Homes do DAILY | Clean Home Habits","10 things people with (Desirable Possession) do DAILY | (Desirable Possession) Habits","+2926","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants a clean home. Authority – This leverages the authority of “people with Clean Homes”. Daily – Doing something daily makes it feel more tangible and interesting."
"If I Wanted to Go From $0 to $1M in 12 Months, Here’s What I’d Do","If I Wanted to Go From (Starting Point) to (End Goal) in (Relatively Short Time Frame), Here’s What I’d Do","+423","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to go from $0 to $1M in 12 months. Beginners – “Going From $0” insinuates this video is for beginners, which attracts the biggest, hungriest group in any audience. Time Frame – The time frame of “in 12 months” makes this video more tangible and interesting. Plus, since it’s relatively short, it increases desire, too. Curiosity – This ends by opening a loop and making you want to know what he’d do."
"7 Signs That Someone Dislikes You and is Hiding it | STOIC PHILOSOPHY","7 Signs (Negative Occurance) (Concealing Action)","+2188","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This is all about drama, which people love. Curiosity – “and is Hiding it” makes you feel like there’s some secrecy going on."
"iOS 18.1 Settings To Turn OFF Now! (Important!)","[Entity] Settings To Turn OFF NOW! (Important)","+2400","Negativity – This video warning viewers about turning settings off has 3.4M views, while the video about turning settings on from the same channel only has 471K views. Turning settings off brings fear of what might happen if you don’t turn them off, instead of turning them on and thinking about the benefits you’d get from them. Curiosity – This title is vague and open-ended, which builds curiosity about what the settings are and what could happen if you don’t turn them off. Timeliness – iOS 18.1 was just released, so people are thinking about this topic right now."
"This Stupid TRICK Helped Me Play In Every Key On Guitar","This Stupid TRICK Helped Me (Achieve Goal)","+3513","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to be able to play every key on guitar. And note that this isn’t just about getting better at guitar. It’s a specific desire, and the word “Every” gives it an almost epic feeling. Curiosity – This builds curiosity in two ways: It opens a loop and makes you want to know what the trick is.



It’s counterintuitive that a “stupid” trick would help you do something awesome. Negativity – This isn’t about a cool trick, it’s about a “stupid” trick, which grabs attention."
"27 Years of No Bullsh*t Sales Advice in 16 Mins","","-90","This title format is trending right now, so why did it flop? Well, the not-fun answer is sometimes videos flop for a variety of complicated reasons and it’s hard to identify exactly what went wrong. But we don’t do not-fun answers here. This section is to brainstorm ways we’d improve the packaging, so let’s do it. One of my go-to moves in titles and thumbnails is to challenge assumptions. In this case, instead of “This Sh*t Is So Easy” in the thumbnail, I’d use challenge common sales assumptions by saying something like “Stop Following Up” or “Stop Using A Script”. You could also build curiosity with something like, “I Wish I Knew This…” Regarding the title, we could try to simplify it by shortening it to, “27 Years of Sales Advice in 16 Mins”. If the topic and/or thumbnail are both great, you often don’t need a fancy title to get people to click. Or we could change the angle and make it more specific by trying something like, “Everything You Need To Know About Selling Software In 2025”. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"How I Gained 50,000 Followers In 1 Month (9 Easy Steps)","How I [Achieved Goal] In [Short Time Frame] ([Number] Easy Steps)","+753","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to get 50,000 followers in 1 month. Plus, “9 Easy Steps” adds to the desire by making it sound easy. Time Frame – The short time frame of “In 1 Month” also adds to the desire and makes this video feel more tangible and interesting. Credibility – This isn’t just a “how to” video, this is a “how I” video, which makes it feel more credible."
"An Ancient Roman Shipwreck May Explain the Universe","An (Obscure Entity) May Explain (Bigger Entity)","+1433","Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it’s counterintuitive that something seemingly meaningless, like an ancient Roman shipwreck, can do something so meaningful, like explain the universe. Epic – Explaining the entire universe is pretty epic."
"4 Nuts You Should Be Eating And 4 You Shouldn’t","(Number) (Entities) You Should Be (Activity) And (Number) You Shouldn’t","+3399","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire & Negativity – This covers both ends of the spectrum with nuts you should and shouldn’t eat. Curiosity – These two lists of nuts you should and shouldn’t eat do a great job of building curiosity because you’ve gotta click to find out what the nuts are. Note: I typically don’t like using the word “and” in titles because it dilutes the focus, but here’s a great example of that being a preference, not a rule."
"Why is EVERYONE Leaving Florida? (WHAT’S REALLY GOING ON?)","Why is EVERYONE (Negative Action)? (WHAT’S REALLY GOING ON?)","+16349","Negativity – This controversial topic does a great job of grabbing the audience’s attention. Curiosity – This question builds curiosity, and “WHAT’S REALLY GOING ON?” adds a bit of secrecy and conspiracy."
"A Scientist’s Guide To Composting","","-75","There are probably a few reasons that contributed to this video flopping: It’s not dramatic enough. Many of the best titles from this channel have some drama, like “An Ancient Roman Shipwreck May Explain the Universe” (4.5M views) or “The Doorway to the Underworld is Growing and We Can’t Stop It” (2.5M views).



There’s not much curiosity.



The audience might not be looking for a guide to composting from this channel. We can’t really change #1 — the video just doesn’t have that much drama. And we can’t change #3 — the video is already posted and the audience wants what they want. But we can change #2. Let’s try to add some curiosity to this title: “How Your Trash Can Make The Planet Healthier” “Stop Throwing Away Your Kitchen Trash – Do This Instead” We can also try to increase the desire by making it more tangible or calling out beginners: “3 Steps To Make Perfect Compost In 60 Days” “Everything You Need To Know To Start Composting As A Beginner” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Frightening Pagan History of Halloween | Full Special","The Frightening (Negative Description) History of (Trending Entity)","+800","Timeliness – This video was published 9 days before Halloween. Negativity – This title could’ve been, “The History of Halloween,” but adding some fear and controversy with “Frightening Pagan” makes this title way more interesting. Hint: if you’re reading this now, you may want to consider doing a similar video for the next few holidays coming up."
"The Cruise Rip-Offs Experts NEVER Pay For on a Cruise","The (Niche) Rip-Offs Experts NEVER Pay For (in Specific Situation)","+812","Negativity – “Rip-Offs” are a controversial topic that do a great job of grabbing the audience’s attention. Authority – This leverages the credibility of “Experts” to make this video more desirable and interesting. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know what the rip-offs are."
"The Blueprint to Make $$$ on YouTube from Day 1","The Blueprint to (Achieve Goal) from Day 1","+2443","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to make money on YouTube from Day 1. Beginners – This attracts beginners, the biggest part of any audience, because it’s about “Day 1”. Refute Objection – A lot of people think it takes a lot of time to make money on YouTube, but this title refutes that objection and says you’ll learn how to make money from day 1."
"I paid 5 designers on Fiverr to create a cover for the same book","I paid 5 (People who do activity) on Fiverr to create a (Entity) for the same (Entity)","+7397","Credibility – This title is great because it shows she actually did something interesting, instead of just sharing her thoughts on something. Curiosity – This does a great job at starting a story, but not finishing it, so you’ve gotta click to find out how the designs turned out."
"Large Cruise Ships vs Small Cruise Ships – Which is Better?","","-95","Apparently people don’t care too much about this topic (although it could get decent search traffic long term). So what can we do? We can’t change the intro or the content, but we can try to change the angle of the title and how we position the video. Instead of asking the audience a question, I’d make a bold statement, add my polarizing opinion, and/or build some curiosity: “The WORST Thing About Large Cruise Ships” “Why I ONLY Book Small Cruise Ships” “The #1 Difference Between Small & Large Cruise Ships Every Cruiser Needs To Know” “I Wish I Knew THIS Before Booking My Last Cruise” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks! Hope you enjoyed this week’s edition and if you know a fellow creator who needs help writing better titles, please send them to creatorhooks.com. – Jake (@jthomas__ on Twitter) P.S.

"The New Approach to Personal Branding That Changes Everything","The New Approach to (Activity) That Changes Everything","+649","Desire – This creator’s audience is into personal branding. Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: It makes you wonder what the new approach is.



“Changes Everything” is open-ended and makes you wonder what will change. New Opportunity – People love new opportunities like new approaches because they offer hope."
"The Side of China The Media Won’t Show You","The Side of (Polarizing Topic) The Media Won’t Show You","+1020","Conspiracy & Curiosity – “The Media Won’t Show You” adds some conspiracy and makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. And China is polarizing, which also grabs attention. If this was “The Side of (Unheard of Country) The Media Won’t Show You,” nobody would care."
"Tax Expert Breaks Down Kamala Harris’s Tax Plan (FULL DETAILS)","(Industry Professional) Breaks Down (Trending Authority Figure’s) (Relevant Entity)","+2881","Timeliness – This video was published a few weeks before the election and does a great job of riding the election’s popularity (and polarity). Authority – Since this creator is a tax expert, he has authority regarding tax plans, so you want to hear what he has to say about this topic. Negativity – The thumbnail makes it clear there’s some controversy in this video."
"How to STUDY so FAST that it feels ILLEGAL","How to (Action or Goal) so FAST that it feels ILLEGAL","+4072","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to study fast. Speed – Adding speed (in this case, “study so FAST“) is a great way to enhance your audience’s desire and interest in your video’s topic. Negativity – “feels ILLEGAL” adds a bit of controversy and an edge to this video that makes it feel more exciting."
"Weeds Are the Answer to Your Garden Problems!","(Unwanted Entities) Are the Answer to Your (Entity) Problems!","+500","Curiosity – This is counterintuitive because most people think weeds ARE the garden problems, not the answer to them."
"The 30-MIN METHOD to ditch 99% of the toys","The (Time Frame) METHOD to ditch 99% of the (Unwanted Entities)","+994","Desire – This creator’s audience would love for their kids to ditch the toys. Time Frame – “30-MIN” makes this method sound more tangible, achievable, and interesting. Curiosity – You know what this method does and how long it takes, but you don’t know anything about how to execute it, so you’ve gotta click and find out."
"The 7-Day Challenge That Changed My Life (You Can Do It Too!)","The 7-Day [Niche] Challenge That Changed My Life (You Can Do It Too!)","+1893","Time Frame – “7-Day” makes this challenge sound more tangible, achievable, and interesting. Desire – Most people would love to change their life. Curiosity – This title is vague, but interesting. The time frame and “change my life” both make this challenge sound interesting, but you have no other details besides those two, so you’ve gotta click to learn more."
"If You Know These 15 Words, Your English is EXCELLENT!","If You (Activity) These 15 (Entities), Your (Skill or Possession) is EXCELLENT!","+5363","Curiosity – This does a great job of opening a loop and making you wonder what these 15 words are. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to have excellent English."
"What the Forest Taught Me About Gardening","","-77","This title is a little bland and boring. The video is about lazy gardening (aka gardening without watering or weeding), and here are some of the previous titles she tried (thanks, Viewstats Chrome extension): The Ultimate Lazy Garden, and What It Has to Teach Us



Lazy Gardening on Steroids: 7 Lessons From the Forest



The World’s Laziest Garden, and What It Has to Teach Us



The World’s Laziest Garden (The Forest), and What It Has to Teach Us



The World’s Laziest Garden! | FULL Backyard Forest Tour!



The World’s Laziest Garden! | Backyard Forest Tour!



What the Forest Has to Teach Us About Gardening It seems like she really only tried two angles: lazy gardening and what the forest teaches us about gardening. Here are a few ways we could mix it up: We could specifically call out the main benefit of lazy gardening: “The Secret To Having A Garden You Don’t Need To Water Or Weed” We could zoom out, be a little vague, and just hint at a big benefit: “This Gardening Secret Changed My Life Forever” Or we could add a hint of regret: “I Wish I Knew THIS About Gardening 10 Years Ago” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Tennis Has A Serious Pickleball Problem…","(Entity) Has A Serious (Similar Entity) Problem…","+679","Negativity – There’s drama and conflict in this title, which people love."
"15 Things To Do If You Get Rich All Of A Sudden","15 Things To Do If You (Suddenly Reach Your Biggest Goal)","+916","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to get rich all of a sudden. But instead of this being a realistic scenario for most people, it’s probably more of an entertaining potential dream scenario."
"*NEVER* do THIS when visiting Italy!","*NEVER* do THIS when (Activity)!","+1756","Negativity – This title is a simple warning that does a great job at grabbing the audience’s attention. Curiosity – This also opens a loop and makes you wonder what exactly it is that he’s doing wrong."
"Fix 90% of Your Body’s Problems in 30 Days","Fix 90% of Your (Entity’s) Problems in 30 Days","+3959","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to fix 90% of their body’s problems. Negativity – This is all about pain points and problems, which grabs the audience’s attention. Time Frame – The time frame of “30 Days” adds to the desire and makes this feel more tangible and enticing."
"15 Strategies For Thriving When Stocks Drop","","-89","This video’s idea is actually pretty good – what to do when the stock market is falling – but the title doesn’t clearly convey that. “Strategies for Thriving” is too wordy, complicated, and unclear. Here are some some ways we could rewrite this: “15 Investing Tips For When Stocks Drop” “Do THIS When The Stock Market Crashes” “This Is What Billionaires Do When Stocks Drop” To avoid this mistake, make sure you’re using clear, simple words in your title.

"The Smallest Full Frame Camera You’ve Ever Seen","The (Extreme, Counterintuitive Object) You’ve Ever Seen","+460","Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: There’s a bit of contrast between “smallest” and “full frame”.



It makes you want to know what camera this is. Extreme – “Smallest” and “You’ve Ever Seen” both make this title extreme and unique. Desire – This creator’s audience likes small full frame cameras."
"These Common Behaviors Are MAJOR TSA Red Flags","These Common (Actions or Entities) Are MAJOR (Entity) Red Flags","+511","Negativity – “Red Flags” does a great job at grabbing attention. Nobody wants to do these common behaviors and accidentally get in trouble. Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: It’s counterintuitive that “common behaviors” would be “major red flags”.



This does a good job of opening a loop and making you wonder what these common behaviors are."
"I Finally Got a Tesla Cybertruck and It Scares the Crap Out of Me","I Finally Got a (Trending Product) and It Scares the Crap Out of Me","+1073","Trending – Tesla Cybertrucks are still trending right now, which brings a lot of attention to this title. Negativity – “It Scares the Crap Out of Me” brings some fear here. Curiosity – “It Scares the Crap Out of Me” also builds curiosity because it’s so vague and makes you want to know why it scares him so much."
"Turn a Handkerchief Into a Spectacular Gift in 10 Minutes","Turn a (Mundane Object) Into a (Amazing, Different Object) in (Short Time Frame)","+3271","Desire – This creator’s audience loves to turn regular things in spectacular things. Time Frame – The short time frame of “in 10 minutes” adds to that desire because it makes it feel tangible and accomplishable. Curiosity – The contrast between “handkerchief” and “spectacular gift” builds curiosity and interest."
"These 3 Dressings Will Upgrade Any Salad | Epicurious 101","","-77","This title isn’t bad. It’s straightforward and benefit-driven, but apparently not spicy enough (this video got 67K views, but the channel averages about 257K). Here are a few ways we could mix it up: We could add a constraint: “The Only 3 Salad Dressings You Need” We could try to hype it up more: “These 3 Salad Dressings Will Change Your Life” Or we could make it a bit more tangible and add an even crazier benefit: “3 Home-Made Salad Dressings To Make Him Fall In Love With You” Of course, there’s always the fact that this audience just might not be into salad dressings, but that’s whole different topic.

"These 2 Easy Upgrades Keep Garages Comfy Year Round","These 2 Easy Upgrades (Achieve Specific Goal)","+479","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to keep their garages comfy year-round. Plus, “easy” enhances the audience’s desire for these upgrades. Curiosity – This does a great job at opening a loop because it says there are two upgrades, but doesn’t specify what they are, so you’ve gotta click to find out. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"10 Years of Mixing Advice in 10 Minutes","10 Years of (Activity) Advice in 10 Minutes","+537","Desire – This title leverages desire two ways: This creator’s audience wants mixing advice



They’re getting a lot in a little (10 years in just 10 minutes). Credibility – Sharing how many years of experience you have (if it’s significant) does a great job at building credibility. Time Frame – People love time frames, and this title has two of them. “10 Years” builds credibility and “10 minutes” increases the desire and lets you know exactly what you’re getting in this video."
"I’m 40. If You’re In Your 20’s Watch This","I’m (Authority Position). If You’re (Beginner) Watch This","+645","Credibility – This starts with a simple statement showing why people should listen to him. Specific Audience – If you’re in your 20s, you feel like this video was made specifically for you, so you’re more likely to watch."
"RETIREMENT REGRETS: Top 5 regrets from elderly (70-80 yrs old) retirees!","(Activity) REGRETS: Top 5 regrets from (Experienced Group)","+26750","Negativity – Regrets make great video topics because they’re so tangible and emotional. Nobody wants to have regrets. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Credibility – Since these are regrets from elderly retirees who have been where the audience is planning on going, these regrets feel more credible."
"Energy Coach Shares 3 Secrets to a Long and Happy Life","","-98","This video makes two big mistakes: It’s a different video format from the rest of the channel. This is a clip from Sky News, not a talking head video like all the other videos. I’d guess that as soon as people click on it and see it’s a news segment, they’re clicking off the video.



The title and thumbnail feel like they’re coming from a news channel. They feel stuffy and cheesy, whereas his other videos (you can see the “I’m 40” video above as an example) feel more natural and organic. The title isn’t even that bad, but when paired with that newsy screenshot for the thumbnail, it instantly feels more sleazy. To avoid a flop like this, make your thumbnails, titles, and videos in a consistent format. I’m assuming this creator wanted to build some authority by showing he was on the news. If it were me and I wanted to do this, I’d probably just mention it in a video that had the same packaging and content style as my other videos, as opposed to sharing the whole clip.

"How to Run Fast at a Low Heart Rate","How to (Achieve Goal) (With Constraint)","+470","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to run fast at a low heart rate. Plus, running at a low heart rate (Zone 2, for the running nerds) is a hot trend right now. Constraint – Running fast is easy, but the constraint of doing it at a low heart rate makes it much more difficult. This increases the desire and the intrigue of this video. Curiosity – There’s also a bit of counterintuitiveness here because most people would assume if you’re running fast you don’t have a low heart rate."
"We Put 7 Uber Drivers in One Room. What We Found Will Shock You.","We (Tangible Action). What We Found Will Shock You.","+609","Negativity – “It’s Illegal” in the thumbnail does a great job at grabbing attention and bringing the drama. Curiosity – This title opens a loop and makes you wonder what they found. Credibility – This isn’t just conjecture. Since they actually put 7 Uber drivers in a room it makes this video feel way more believable."
"The Month You Retire Really Matters","The (Seemingly Insignificant Detail) You (Activity) Really Matter","+672","Curiosity – This is counterintuitive because most people would assume the month you retire doesn’t matter."
"8 Ways for Seniors to Sleep Better Tonight","8 Ways for (Specific Audience) to (Solve Specific Problem Quickly)","+3541","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Specific Audience – Calling out seniors makes them feel like this video was made for them, so they’re way more likely to click. Desire – This leverages desire two ways: Many seniors wish they could sleep better.



“Tonight” adds to the desire because we all want our desires asap."
"Chicago Just Guaranteed Vacation Days for Everyone","","-96","This title is too narrow. If you don’t live in Chicago, you probably don’t care about this video. It might have been better to skip this video because it’s got such a narrow audience, but since that ship has sailed, let’s take a crack at some other ways they could write this title. “This Is The Best City In America For Working Class People” “This American City Just Changed Work-Life Balance Forever” “You Get Guaranteed Vacation Days If You Live In This City” These titles add some curiosity and appeal to a larger audience.

"The One-Man-Show Making & Delivering NYC’s Hottest Sandwiches | On The Line | Bon Appétit","The (Constraint) (Impressive Activity)","+615","Constraint – The constraint of “One-Man-Show” does two things here: It builds curiosity. How can just one man make and deliver NYC’s hottest sandwiches?



It increases desire and relatability. If this one man can do it, maybe I can too?"
"This Sea Is the Most Mysterious in the World","This (Entity) Is the Most Mysterious in the World","+764","Curiosity – “Mysterious” is a simple, but great way to build curiosity. Epic – “Most Mysterious in the World” makes this video feel extreme and epic, which makes it way more interesting."
"French Dressing Rules EVERYONE Should Learn Once And For ALL","(Authority) (Activity) Rules EVERYONE Should Learn Once And For ALL","+849","Authority – The French are known for being excellent dressers, so this title leverages their authority. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to dress better and this title essentially promises they will learn how to do that."
"Upcoming Action Sequels You Had No Idea Were Being Made","Upcoming (Entities) You Had No Idea Were (Activity)","+1967","Desire – This creator’s audience likes action sequels and everybody likes to hear news about upcoming things they like. Curiosity – “You Had No Idea Were Being Made” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret."
"Is AI Making The Dating World Harder to Date?","","-89","There are two big problems with this title. The first and biggest problem is that this channel’s audience doesn’t seem to be interested in this topic. In the last 5 months, this is the only video about AI. (I do love trying out new topics to try to find new opportunities, but sometimes it just doesn’t work out!) To avoid this problem, when you’re evaluating potential ideas for your channel one of the best questions to ask yourself is if it has worked on your channel before. The next problem is that it’s a weak question. Bold, confident, opinionated statements often work better as YouTube titles than questions. People are watching this channel to learn, and this question doesn’t really tell me I’m going to learn anything. Plus, I already know the answer because it’s a leading question and because of the expressions in the thumbnail. To avoid this problem, write your titles as bold, opinionated statements.

"The Laziest AI Side Hustle to Make Money Online in 2024","The Laziest (Trending Opportunity) to (Achieve Goal) in (Current Year)","+409","Desire – This leverages desire 3 ways. This creator’s audience wants to make money online.



They’re excited about side hustles.



It’s about “lazy” side hustles. Laziness enhances the desire because it makes it seem like it’s going to be easy. I’ve seen “lazy” work several times on YouTube. I’ve also seen it flop a few times, but I think it’s an interesting angle worth exploring. Timeliness – This leverages timeliness two ways: It uses in the current year.



AI is still an exciting, trending topic."
"Women’s reaction to unattractive VS handsome men [Comparison]","(Authority Figure)’s reaction to (Undesirable) VS (Desirable Trait) (Entity) [Comparison]","+461","Curiosity – There’s contrast here (unattractive vs. handsome) and it opens a loop because you want to see how the women will react. Authority – When it comes to unattractive vs handsome men, women are an authority and people whose opinion men value."
"Best Updates to Sell an Older Home (Without BREAKING the Bank!)","Best [Actions] to [Activity] a [Underdog Entity] (Without [Biggest Objection]!)","+520","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to sell their older home without spending a ton of money. Refute Objection – Many people assume these updates are going to cost a lot of money, but “(Without BREAKING the Bank!)” gets rid of that objection and makes this video more interesting. Negativity – This is about selling older homes, not new, fancy homes. Older homes may be harder to sell, so this targets a specific group of people with a pain point."
"Famous atheists last words before dying..","Famous (Contrarian Figure)’s last (Actions) before (Negative Event)..","+2034","Negativity – A big, negative event like dying increases the significance of somebody’s last actions and words. Plus, this is from a Christian channel, so the fact that this is an atheist’s last words adds to the drama. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know what their last words are."
"This Guy BROKE The YouTube Algorithm – Here’s What You can Learn From Him","","-82","This video is great, but the title focuses on the wrong thing. Most of the titles on this channel focus on benefits for the audience as listicles or personal stories: “How I Made a Faceless YouTube Channel Using AI ($10K/Month Revenue)”



“The Laziest AI Side Hustle to Make Money Online in 2024” And all of the thumbnails have the creator’s face in them. But this packaging focuses on a guy the audience doesn’t necessarily know. At first I thought this video was a podcast or testimonial. Neither of these things are in line with what works on this channel, so that’s probably the biggest reason why this flopped. But then I watched the video and I realized it’s actually about a tactic that highlights how the YouTube algorithm worked. So instead of focusing the title on the guy who broke the algorithm, it probably would’ve been smarter to focus the title on the tactic and/or the benefits the viewer would get after using the tactic. Here are two examples: This Simple Trick Exposed The YouTube Algorithm



3 Things Every YouTuber Needs To Know to About The Algorithm In 2025 Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"24 HOURS WITH A NEWBORN | Our Daily Routine (As First Time Parents)","24 HOURS WITH A [New Entity] | Our Daily Routine (As First [Profession])","+437","Time Frame – The time frame of “24 Hours” makes this video more tangible and, therefore, more interesting. Daily – Daily things, like “Daily Routine” are also very tangible and interesting. Beginners – This is all about new babies and new parents. New parents typically struggle more than experienced parents, so new parents will gravitate more toward this because they feel like it’s made for them. Plus, since they’re struggling, they’re more likely to watch a video about it. (This goes for most things — not just parenting.)"
"Etsy FINALLY has a Competitor","(Polarizing Entity) FINALLY has a Competitor","+714","Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know who Etsy’s competitor is. Negativity – There’s a hint of drama in the title and a lot of drama in the thumbnail. Desire – Not everybody loves Etsy, so this title excites those people who want an Etsy alternative. News – “FINALLY” makes this feel like this video is breaking news."
"5 Warning Signs Your Body Needs More Nutrients… | Dr Mindy Pelz","5 Warning Signs (Something Needs to Improve)…","+749","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Warning signs make for great video ideas because we’re wired to listen to warnings. I also love this thumbnail because it’s clear, relatable, and builds curiosity because it makes you want to know what’s going on with the circled part of the nail."
"Top 11 No Interview Remote Jobs for Introverts","Top 11 No (Hard Thing) (Desirable Things) for (Specific Audience)","+3699","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Refute Objection – Many introverts don’t like interviews, so “No Interview” gets rid of that objection. Specific Audience – By calling out introverts in the title it makes them feel like this video was made specifically for them, which makes them more likely to click. Desire – All of the points above, as well as this being about remote jobs, increase the audience’s desire for these jobs and this video."
"What’s ONE Etsy tip that changed your life?","","-87","This video probably flopped for a simple reason: it’s a question, not a confident statement. This creator’s audience wants her to tell them how to succeed on Etsy. They want to know that she has the answers to all of their problems, not throw questions back at them. This video probably would’ve done much better if it was, “This ONE Etsy Tip Changed My Life.” To avoid this mistake yourself, make bold statements in your titles and help your audience know you can solve their problems. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks! Hope you enjoyed this week’s edition and if you know a fellow creator who needs help writing better titles, please send them to creatorhooks.com. – Jake (@jthomas__ on Twitter) P.S.

"This Chart Predicts Every Recession (it’s happening again)","This [Entity] Predicts Every [Negative Event] (it’s happening again)","+444","Negativity – Scary events, like recessions, grab people’s attention and interest. Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: It’s talking about the future and the future is a naturally curiosity-filled topic.



It opens a loop and makes you want to know more about the chart and the upcoming recession."
"This Is Why You Can’t Go To Antarctica","This Is Why You Can’t (Activity)","+696","The biggest reason this video did so well is probably that the thumbnail contains all of the major conspiracies around Antarctica. And the title is simple, but builds curiosity because it’s open-ended."
"6 Levels of Thinking Every Student MUST Master","6 Levels of (Activity) Every (Position) MUST Master","+888","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Specific Audience – Calling out students makes students more likely to click this video because they feel like it was made specifically for them. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to get better at thinking and become geniuses (like the thumbnail says). Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know what the 6 levels are."
"11 YouTube Settings Small Channels Must Turn ON","11 (Entity) Settings (Beginners) Must Turn ON","+1819","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Specific Audience – Calling out “Small Channels” makes small channel owners feel like this video was made specifically for them. And since most channels are small, this has a huge potential audience. “Settings” – Videos about settings often do well. My theory is that they’re very tangible and easy to turn on/off, unlike strategies or tips that require work and thinking."
"How To Pick your Perfect Career (the Ultimate Guide) – Part 1","","-95","This flop of the week is a two-parter: both parts 1 and 2 for “How to Pick Your Perfect Career” got much fewer views than this channels average (17K and 27K compared to the channel’s recent average of 366K views). There are a handful of things I think could’ve been better with these videos: These could’ve been one video. Together they’re only 21 minutes, so it’s not so long that it needs to be broken into two videos. The hardest part of a video is getting somebody to click and watch the first 30 seconds, so breaking this video into two videos means you have to get somebody to click and watch the first 30 seconds twice instead of once.



The fact that this video is a two-parter and the first video is only 9 minutes long doesn’t really say “Ultimate Guide” to me (though if these were one, it would make a lot more sense).



The thumbnail of the first video doesn’t really make it clear who this video is for.



The thumbnail text in the first video removes some of the curiosity — we already know it’s about the Ikigai framework. It’d be worth testing something that builds more curiosity and makes it clear who this video is for. Something like, “Do This To Find Your Best Career.”



The topic is for a specific audience at a specific point of time, whereas some of the other videos, like “6 Levels of Thinking Every Student MUST Master” are more broadly appealing. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Economist explains why India can never grow like China","(Authority Figure) explains why (Entity) can never (Achieve Goal) like (Similar Entity)","+428","Authority – Starting this off with “Economist Explains” makes this video feel more trustworthy. Curiosity – India and China are similar enough that where it’s counterintuitive that India could never grow like China (this is coming from a simple Florida man, so apologies if this outlook is wrong.) Negativity – There’s a bit of competition, conflict and drama in this title that makes it interesting. Bold Statement – A bold and polarizing statement like this grabs attention and invites people who both agree and disagree with the statement to watch the video. It would’ve been much less powerful if the title was, “Economist explains why India probably won’t grow like China.”"
"9 Huge LIES about Buying a $100,000 Camper Van Nobody Talks About (RV Life)","9 Huge LIES about (Big Action) Nobody Talks About","+461","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – “Huge LIES” does a great job bringing the drama and grabbing attention. Curiosity – “Nobody Talks About” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret."
"Why The Rich Put EVERYTHING In Their Living Trust","Why (Authority Figures) (Extreme Action)","+1896","Authority – This title builds credibility because it’s about what the rich do with their money. Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: Putting “EVERYTHING” in a living trust is extreme, which builds curiosity.



This opens a loop and makes you wonder why they put everything in their living trust. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to make more money and be like the rich."
"He secretly changed this freeway sign, helped millions of drivers","He secretly (Illegal Action), helped (Large number of entities)","+10610","Curiosity – This builds curiosity three ways: “Secretly” changing a sign makes this feel rebellious and secretive.



It’s counterintuitive that vandalizing something would help lots of people.



We know he changed the sign and helped millions of drivers, but we don’t know what he changed and how it helped people, so this opens a loop."
"Harvard Professor Reveals the Worst Thing To Do with Your Money","(Authority Figure) Reveals the Worst Thing To Do with Your (Posession)","+700","Authority – This title builds trust and credibility because it name drops an authority figure. Negativity – This title leverages fear because nobody wants to mess up with their money. Curiosity – “Reveals” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret."
"92% of Homeowners Use Teflon Pipe Tape Wrong – Here’s Why it Leaks","92% of (Specific Audience) Use (Tool) Wrong – Here’s Why (Problem)","+1008","Negativity – Telling somebody they’re using something simple wrong is a great way to grab their attention. Also, “Here’s Why it Leaks” mentions a problem this audience is experiencing, which also gets them interested. Curiosity – Finishing this with “Here’s Why it Leaks” opens a loop and builds curiosity."
"What I Learned From My Failed Coffee Shop","What I Learned From My Failed (Big Project)","+3463","Negativity – People love hearing about failure stories because they want to avoid it for themselves (among other potentially more negative reasons). Curiosity – This does a great job at opening a loop and making you want to know what he learned. Big Stakes – This might not have done as well if this was “What I learned from my failed coffee ebook,” but since this was such a big undertaking, it’s more interesting."
"5 Common Medications That Can Damage Your Liver | Healthy Care","5 Common (Solutions) That Can Damage Your (Possession)","+7071","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This leverages the fear of damaging your liver. And this fear is increased because these medications are common. Curiosity – There’s contrast between “common medications” (things that are assumed to be good for you) and “damage your liver.”"
"Adobe is horrible. So I tried the alternative","(Leading Product or Method) is horrible. So I tried the alternative","+520","Negativity – This starts out with a common complaint that this creator’s audience has, which does a great job of grabbing their attention. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what happened when he tried the alternative. Authority – Since Adobe is the most popular product in the space, it grabs people’s attention. New Opportunity – If you think Adobe is horrible and would like to find an alternative, this title gets you excited and gives you hope."
"The REAL Truth About Growing Avocados from Seed – (this took 6 years)","The REAL Truth About [Doing activity from scratch] – ([Proof of effort])","+649","Curiosity – “The REAL Truth” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Credibility – Saying this took 6 years makes this video feel more believable."
"13 American Accents Ranked EASIEST to HARDEST to Understand","13 (Entities) Ranked EASIEST to HARDEST to (Action)","+1299","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – Ranked lists build curiosity because you want to know what’s the best, worst, and where you’re at on the list."
"If you’re single but want a girlfriend, this video was literally made for you…","If you’re (Problem State) but want a (Solution), this video was literally made for you…","+1449","Specific Audience – This title makes it crystal clear who this video is for, which makes the target audience way more likely to click. Negativity & Desire – Calling out the problem (being single) and the exact solution (getting a girlfriend) does a great job at grabbing the audience’s attention and getting them to click. Curiosity – The thumbnail opens a loop because you want to know what saved his dating life."
"I make youtube videos so you can just copy me","","-92","This video probably flopped for several reasons. Let’s talk about the title first. This title violates the #1 rule of writing YouTube titles: be clear, not clever. This video is about his process for making YouTube videos, but that’s not very clear from the title. There are two ways we could improve it. The first is to make it more clear. Something like, “My Step By Process Process For Making YouTube Videos in 2024” But the second is to talk not about what the video is about, but about the end goal. Something like, “This Simple Process Helped Me Hit 100,000 YouTube Subscribers” The other reason this video probably flopped is because it’s about the wrong topic. People seem to want to watch this channel for tech tips. Here are some of his best videos: Adobe is horrible. So I tried the alternative (833K views)



The Linux Experience (695K views)



First PC Building Experience (519K views) A video about how to grow on YouTube doesn’t really fit here. If you want to avoid these mistakes, write clear titles and make content your audience wants to watch on your channel. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks! Hope you enjoyed this week’s edition and if you know a fellow creator who needs help writing better titles, please send them to creatorhooks.com. – Jake (@jthomas__ on Twitter) P.S. Read previous editions here. P.P.S. If you want to see all of the videos from Creator Hooks in one place, check out Creator Hooks Pro. Read last week’s edition »"
"The Crispiest Smashed Potatoes That Will Change Your Life","The (Superlative Adjective) (Entity) That Will Change Your Life","+553","Desire – This creator’s audience is into smashed potatoes. Plus, the word “crispiest” makes you almost taste and feel them in your mouth. Extreme – Extreme things (like “Crispiest Smashed Potatoes”) often make for good video topics because they’re unique and interesting. “Change Your Life” – I’ve seen this phrase work a lot in YouTube titles, so it’s worth mentioning here."
"PLUMBERS HATE me for sharing their SECRET","(Professionals or Authority Figures) HATE me for sharing their SECRET","+734","Curiosity – “Secret” makes you feel like you’re getting insider information here. Negativity – “Hate” brings some drama here and increases the value of the secret. Authority – Plumbers represent authority figures here, which also increases the value of the secret."
"I can’t get a job to save my life (1500+ applications) | Tech 2024","I can’t (Achieve Goal) to save my life ([Proof of Effort])","+1136","Negativity – Admitting a problem lots of people are struggling with is a great way to grab your audience’s attention. Credibility – This isn’t just him complaining after submitting a few applications. He says he submitted 1500+, which increases the magnitude of this problem. Timeliness – It’s well known that the job market is tough right now, plus this creator emphasizes that by dropping in “Tech 2024” at the end."
"How the Most Underrated High School Recruit made the NFL","How the Most Underrated (Entity) (Achieved Big Goal)","+11947","Curiosity – There’s contrast between “Most Underrated High School Recruit” and “made the NFL”, and it’s counterintuitive this would happen, too. Underdog – People love stories about underdogs."
"Street Photography With “The Bigma”","(Activity) With “The (Product Nickname)”","+418","Curiosity – This thumbnail is probably the main reason this video got so many views, and that’s because it builds curiosity two ways: The lens is enormous, which makes it unique, unexpected, and stick out on YouTube.



There’s contrast between “Huge Lens” and “Tiny Camera” and that’s accentuated by the font size. The title also accentuates the product’s uniqueness because it uses its funny nickname and puts it in quotes."
"Ancient Chinese Records of Jesus Change EVERYTHING We Knew About Christianity","Ancient (Entity) Records of (Entity) Change EVERYTHING We Knew About (Entity)","+509","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: “Ancient Chinese Records” feels mysterious.



“Change EVERYTHING We Knew” opens a loop and makes you want to know what changed. Credibility – “Ancient Chinese Records” makes the source of this video feel a bit more credible than just some random guy’s opinion."
"This RARE V8 Economy Car DESTROYED Everyone – The Motion Vega","This RARE (Counterintuitive Entity) (Impressive Action)","+636","Curiosity – There’s lots of contrast and counterintuitiveness here that builds curiosity: “V8 Economy Car” is an oxymoron because normally there isn’t a V8 in an economy car.



“Economy Car DESTROYED Everyone” is counterintuitive because normally economy cars are slow. Desire – This creator’s audience loves to learn about rare cars."
"4 MISTAKES Older People Believe in Street Fights that Everyone Knows","4 MISTAKES (Specific Audience) Believe in (Entity) that Everyone Knows","+839","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Nobody wants to make a mistake or believe in mistakes, so this title grabs people’s attention. And it’s even more accentuated by the fact that these are mistakes “Everyone Knows.” Specific Audience – By specifically calling out “older people” it makes older people way more likely to click. Calling out a specific group of people can be a great strategy because they’ll feel like you made the video specifically for them."
"The UNLIKELY Defender… Story of OVERCOMING FEAR to Stay ALIVE!","","-94","This video probably flopped for two reasons: First, the title could be better. It’s too bland and vague. Two things that could make it better are to add more curiosity and make it more specific. Here’s an example: “How This Regular Guy Stopped A Mass Shooter With His Bare Hands.” It’s counterintuitive to stop a mass shooter with your bare hands, and even more so if you’re just a “regular guy.” Plus, it’s more specific. We know that he stopped a mass shooter with his bare hands, instead of just overcoming fear to stay alive. Being more specific is one way to make a title more interesting. But the second, and more important reason this video flopped is that it doesn’t fit with the rest of the videos on the channel. Most of the videos that do well on this channel are educational videos that provide a benefit to the audience. This is an entertainment video that tells a story. While it’s good to experiment, you run the risk of having your video flop when you don’t give the audience what they want and expect from your channel. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks! Hope you enjoyed this week’s edition and if you know a fellow creator who needs help writing better titles, please send them to creatorhooks.com. – Jake (@jthomas__ on Twitter) P.S.

"When “Gamers” join the real army","When “(Fakers)” join the real (Entity)","+376","Curiosity – The contrast of “Gamers” (who play fake games) and “real army” builds curiosity and humor here."
"The ONLY instrument with NO LIMITS","The ONLY (Item) with NO LIMITS","+444","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: It opens a loop and makes you wonder what instrument this is.



“The ONLY” adds a constraint which makes this way more interesting and adds to the curiosity. Epic – “NO LIMITS” makes this video feel epic. Desire – This creator’s audience likes cool instruments."
"Always Sign Your Art (never date it)","Always [Action] Your [Possession] (never [Similar Action] it)","+458","Negativity – “(never date it)” is a warning that grabs your attention. Curiosity – It’s counterintuitive to “never date” your art. Why wouldn’t you do that? This makes you want to find out why you shouldn’t do something as innocent as signing your art."
"How Hanging Transforms Your Body","How (Simple Action) (Big Result)","+1015","Desire – This creator would love to transform their body, especially by doing something as simple as hanging. Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: It opens a loop and makes you want to know how it transforms your body and what it does to you.



It’s a bit counterintuitive because how would something as simple as just hanging transform your body? New Opportunity – Most videos in this niche are about exercises to help you achieve your goals. Hanging is new*, weird, and simple. If you haven’t tried hanging, and you want to transform your body, this new opportunity gives you hope because this might be the answer you’ve been looking for. *If you’re in this niche it might not be new to you, but to many people it’s new."
"5 minutes and you’ll forget about glasses in 2024!","5 minutes and you’ll forget about (Problem) in (Current Year)!","+491","Negativity – This is all about forgetting a problem this creator’s audience struggles with. (Yes, I know glasses are technically a solution to a problem, but this audience would rather see without glasses, so in this context, glasses are a problem.) Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what’s this solution that only takes 5 minutes and will let you forget about glasses. Time Frame – The time frame of “5 minutes” makes this feel like a simple solution since it’s so short. Timeliness – Dropping “in 2024” lets people know this is relevant right now and speaks specifically to those people who are saying, “Whelp, I guess I gotta get glasses this year.”"
"7 HIDDEN Apps in Microsoft 365 that will EXPLODE Productivity","7 HIDDEN (Tools) that will (Achieve Goal)","+709","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – “Hidden” makes you feel like you’re getting insider knowledge on secret apps. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to explode their productivity. *Quick note about clickbait here. “HIDDEN” and “EXPLODE” in all caps might make make this title come off to some as being too clickbaity. Sure, it does feel a little bit dramatic, but how much hype and emotion you want to convey in your title is totally up to you. Another way he could’ve written this if he wanted to tone it down a bit is, “7 Hidden Apps in Microsoft 365 that saved me 10 hours per week”. A little bit more specific and less dramatic. But again, this is up to you, your channel, your audience, and the vibe you want to give off. And since this worked so well for this creator, I can’t knock him for it."
"I Invested $5 a Day for 2 1/2 Years. Here’s What Happened.","I (Activity) a Day for (Long Time Frame). Here’s What Happened.","+713","Curiosity – “Here’s What Happened” opens a loop and makes you want to know what happened. Time Frame – The time frame of 2 1/2 years adds credibility to this because it’s so long. It makes you value and trust this video more. Daily – Investing $5 every day makes this video more tangible, simple to understand, and interesting. “I Invested $4,565 over 2 1/2 years” sounds more complicated and less interesting than “I Invested $5 a Day for 2 1/2 Years.” Credibility – This isn’t about theory or a hypothetical situation, this creator is showing what he actually did. This adds credibility and makes you more interested in the video and trust the creator."
"How I travel the world with just a carry-on  (pack with me for Europe!)","How I (Cool Activity) with (Constraint)","+837","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to travel the world and they’d like to do it without having to lug around lots of big bags. Constraint – The constrait of “with just a carry-on” makes this more challenging and interesting, and increases the desire."
"Restore this MUSCLE and your BACK will be like NEW!","","-90","This title isn’t clear or simple enough. What does “Restore this muscle” actually mean? A better way to write this could be, “Do These 3 EXERCISES Every Day and your BACK will be like NEW!” Exercises are more tangible and clear than restoring muscles. And since restoring a muscle doesn’t really mean anything, so you’re less interested in this video. To avoid this mistake, use words in your title that your audience uses and understands. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks! Hope you enjoyed this week’s edition and if you know a fellow creator who needs help writing better titles, please send them to creatorhooks.com. – Jake (@jthomas__ on Twitter) P.S. Read previous editions here. P.P.S. If you want to see all of the videos from Creator Hooks in one place, check out Creator Hooks Pro. Read last week’s edition »"
"The 2023 NBA Draft Looks Completely Different 1 Year Later","The (Event or Entity) Looks Completely Different 1 Year Later","+430","Curiosity – “Looks Completely Different” is open-ended and makes you wonder what it looks like now. Time Frame – “1 Year Later” makes this video more tangible and interesting. Timeliness – This video was published a bit before the 2024 NBA Draft, when everybody was talking about the Draft."
"My honest advice to someone who wants financial freedom","My honest advice to someone who wants (Goal)","+493","Desire – This creator’s audience wants financial freedom. Authenticity – Authenticity is working really well on YouTube right now and “my honest advice” fits right in with that wave. Authority – Although this isn’t shown in the title, Ali has lots of authority when it comes to financial freedom, so he’s somebody whose “honest advice” is worth listening to."
"The Top Reasons People Regret Moving To Tampa Florida","The Top Reasons People Regret (Action)","+1004","Negativity – Regrets make great video topics because they’re such powerful, tangible, negative emotions. Nobody wants to accidentally make a mistake and have to live with regrets."
"This MICRO Canal is Actually Loaded w/ Fish? (Insane)","This (Unimpressive Entity) is Actually (Unexpected, Desirable Trait)","+1132","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to find a canal loaded with fish. Curiosity – There’s contrast and counterintuitiveness here. You might think a micro canal (especially the one in the thumbnail that looks like it’s in a desert) would have no fish, but this title says it’s actually loaded with fish."
"pretending I SUCK at drawing, then drawing them","pretending I SUCK at (Activity), then (Activity)","+539","Curiosity – This builds so much curiosity because you want to see how the people will react once they realize this creator is actually a pro at drawing, and not a scrub like they originally thought. The drastic difference of the expectation of the audience (this creator sucks at drawing) vs. reality (they’re excellent) convinces us that their reaction will be entertaining."
"We Accidentally Started A Chocolate Company — Now It Brings In $162 Million A Year","We Accidentally (Activity) — Now It (Achieves Huge Goal)","+612","Desire – This channel’s audience would love to start a business that makes $162 million/year. Plus, doing it with a chocolate company (instead of something boring, like plumbing) makes this story even more appealing. Curiosity – It’s counterintuitive to “accidentally” do something really hard, like starting a business that makes $162 million/year, so this builds curiosity and interest."
"Quick T-Shirt Tricks to Tighten a Loose Neckline","Quick (Entity) Tricks to (Solve Problem)","+2483","Negativity – This is about solving a problem — loose necklines. And the thumbnail drives a lot of this video’s success because it shows an easy-to-understand solution to a common problem. Desire – Not only does this creator’s audience want tricks to solve a problem, but people love speed, so “quick” adds to the desire here."
"7 Signs of Undiagnosed Autism in Adults","7 Signs of (Unrealized Trait) in (Specific Audience)","+3446","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Confirms Suspicions – A lot of people are suspicious they might have autism, and this video invites them to watch and confirm (or refute) their suspicions. Negativity – In addition to confirming suspicions in some people, there might also be an element of fear for others. They might see this title and think, “Omg, do I have undiagnosed Autism? I need to watch this!” Specific Audience – By saying this is about “Autism in Adults” it makes it clear who this video is for, which makes adults who think they might have autism feel like this video was made just for them."
"How I Created Realistic AI Influencer from Scratch | AI Model","How I Created (Exciting, Trending Achievement) from Scratch","+399","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to build cool tech products like AI influencers. Plus, making it “from scratch” makes it seem like anyone can do it. Timeliness – Everybody is talking about AI and all the things it can do right now, so this video rides that wave."
"Why don’t we eat carnivores?","Why don’t we (Thing We Surprisingly Never Do)?","+536","Curiosity – I don’t typically like questions as YouTube titles unless they’re really good ones, like this. This makes you go, “Huh, that’s a great question. It should be possible. I wonder why…”"
"Worst Punishments Throughout Human History","Worst (Entities) Throughout (Category) History","+1245","Negativity – People love hearing about scary things like the worst punishments. Extreme & Epic – “Worst” makes this feel extreme (it’s not about just “Really Bad Punishments”) and “Throughout Human History” makes this feel epic."
"What I learned approaching 1000 women in 1000 days","What I learned (Activity for a large number of times) in (Time Frame)","+17919","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn more about talking to women. Credibility – This isn’t just him preaching about how to talk to girls, he’s sharing lessons he learned by actually getting out there and talking to girls. Time Frame – The time frame of 1000 days makes this video feel more tangible, real, and interesting."
"7 Beginner Raised Bed Garden Mistakes to Avoid","7 Beginner (Entity) Mistakes to Avoid","+1034","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Mistakes make for great video topics because we all want to avoid them. Beginner – Calling out beginners makes beginners feel like this video was made for them. This works so well because beginners are the biggest group in any audience and they’re the hungriest to learn."
"The ONE Sign Someone Is Trained to Fight","The ONE Sign (Something Scary is True)","+1400","Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what the one sign is. I think the fact that this is only about one sign intensifies the curiosity (as opposed to 5-10 signs). Plus, it makes this video less intimidating to click on and watch because you just wanna know what the one sign is. Negativity – There’s an undertone of fear here because nobody wants to accidentally fight somebody trained to fight."
"OUTWORK everyone by being bored","(Activity) by being (Unexpected or Opposite Activity)","+1509","Curiosity – This is counterintuitive. How can you outwork everyone by being bored? Desire – This creator’s audience wants to outwork everyone (and they probably don’t want to work that hard — they’d rather be bored)."
"6 TRIPOD Shots that make EVERYTHING CINEMATIC!","6 (Easy Things) that make EVERYTHING (Hard, Desirable Goal)!","+4344","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This leverages desire two ways: 1) This creator’s audience wants to make cinematic videos. 2) Tripod shots are easier than other, more complicated, shots that you would expect to have to take if you want cinematic videos. Curiosity – The contrast between “tripod shots” (easy) and “cinematic” (a more complicated goal) builds curiosity."
"Firing Up a Vietnam-Era Flamethrower","","-82","This video doesn’t match what the audience wants from this channel. Sure, this is a cool flame thrower and this is a pretty entertaining video, but what does the audience want? Here are some of this creator’s most successful recent videos: The ONE Tool That Turns Your Home Into an Unbreachable Fortress



The 4 Most Dangerous Scams To Look Out for in 2024



The ONE Sign Someone Is Trained to Fight All of these videos promise a benefit to the audience to help keep them safe, but this flame thrower video just promises a little entertainment. To avoid this mistake, know why your audience watches your channel and deliver on that. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Here Are 10 SUVs you MUST AVOID!","Here Are 10 (Entities) you MUST AVOID!","+398","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Warnings like this make for great video topics because people don’t want to buy something bad accidentally. Curiosity – The combo of a warning and a list builds a ton of curiosity because you want to know what’s on the list."
"How To Dress Like A RICH WOMAN | Rich Mom Outfits","How To (Activity) Like A (Person You Wanna Be Like)","+1719","Desire – This is an awesome example of knowing your audience. This title could’ve been, “How To Dress Better,” which technically gets the same point across, but speaks less to the deep, specific, tangible desire of this audience. Authority – This creator’s audience wants to dress like rich women."
"Insulated Tent Inside Insulated Tent | Bitter Cold Winter Camping","(Entity) Inside (Same Entity)","+2164","Curiosity – This builds curiosity because you don’t expect it, and you probably haven’t seen anyone else do it, but it also kinda makes a lot of sense."
"I NEVER Felt Like Reading The Bible (How I Changed)","I NEVER Felt Like [Doing Something You Should Do] (How I Changed)","+2506","Negativity – This does a great job at relating to and describing a problem this audience struggles with. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to change and start reading the bible more."
"I Was Surprised By This!! (Unveiling The Denvix Tire Inflator)","","-97","This video clearly doesn’t fit with the rest on this channel: The Top 10 Reliable Luxury Cars You Can Safely Own AFTER Warranty!



AVOID These Junk Cars With The Most Unreliable Engines EVER!



STOP Buying NOW: The Worst Car Brands EVER! Most of the videos on this channel are about types of cars, not car accessories, like this video. On top of that, it’s clearly an ad. Now maybe his sponsorship deal said he had to include the product name in the title, but there are a few others angles he could’ve taken with this video and title: “I Never Leave Home Without This In My Car” This title is a warning and builds curiosity by not saying what the product is. By telling the audience what the product is in the current title, he gives them a chance to say, “No, I don’t want to watch a video about a tire inflator,” (even though they may not realize they really need one and this one has cool benefits and features they didn’t know about). Here’s another angle he could’ve taken: “5 Accessories Everybody Needs In Their Car” This feels less like an ad and opens the opportunity to naturally mention the product while still giving the audience a lot of value.

"The WORST THINGS about living in Baltimore will surprise YOU!","The WORST THINGS about (Thing Your Audience Wants To Do) will surprise YOU!","+621","Negativity – We love hearing about the worst things about something we’re considering doing because we don’t want to make a mistake and do something we’d regret. Curiosity – “will surprise you” implies that you’re gonna learn a secret or something unexpected in this video."
"How The Crips Gang Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider","How (Big, Scary Thing) Actually Works","+749","Negativity – People love scary things, like gangs. Curiosity – “Actually” implies you didn’t really know before, but now you’re finally going to learn the truth. Familiar, Yet Unknown – Everybody knows who the Crips are, but most people don’t know anything about them, which makes for a great, curiosity-filled topic."
"It’s actually pretty easy to get ahead of 99% of people.","It’s actually pretty easy to (Achieve Goal Better Than) 99% of people.","+1518","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to get ahead of 99% of people. Curiosity – It’s hard to get ahead of 99% of people, so this title is counterintuitive. It makes you think, “Am I missing something?” Confidence – The casual nature of this title and the bold statement that something really hard is easy gives off a feeling of confidence that is intoxicating."
"Be Extremely Careful When Peeling The Sticker Of Any Fruit","Be Extremely Careful When (Doing Common or Simple Innocent Thing)","+1566","Negativity – Warnings like this do a great job of grabbing people’s attention and getting them to click. Curiosity – This is counterintuitive because peeling the sticker of of fruits seems like a simple, innocent thing, so why would you need to be extremely careful?"
"This strategy guarantees you get into the Ivy League.","","-92","Most of this creator’s successful videos are broadly appealing, like: You’ve been reading wrong all your life.



This odd mindset shift cured my procrastination forever.



It’s actually pretty easy to get ahead of 99% of people. Nearly everybody can watch and enjoy these videos, but this Ivy League video has only a fraction of the potential audience. One thing he could’ve done was make it a bit broader, like this: “This strategy guarantees you get into your dream school.” (I don’t necessarily love this because it feels like I might be watering the idea down — just throwing it out there as one potential way to broaden it up.) Another thing he could do in the future is just stick to more broadly appealing topics. Now all that being said, this creator offers coaching services to Ivy League applicants. It’s possible he’s making more money from these 9.8K viewers than on some of his videos that are getting over 100K views. If that’s the case, he may want to make even more Ivy League-specific content. Of course, when thinking about strategy for your channel, it all about your goals for the channel. Do you want to maximize views? Or do you have a better way to monetize and it’s actually smarter to go for a smaller, more specific audience? Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The (Overdue) Collapse of the 9-5 Job","The ([Dramatic Description]) Collapse of the [Current Thing]","+452","Negativity – There’s a lot of drama and negativity in this title, which grabs people’s attention and makes it interesting. Confirm Suspicions – Many people these days have been feeling like a regular 9-5 just isn’t working anymore, so this title confirms that suspicion. Curiosity – “(Overdue)” adds a twist and bit of tension to this title, which makes it more interesting."
"12 Things NOT to do in Paris (by a Local)!","12 Things NOT to do in [Entity] (by a [Person with Credibility])!","+862","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Telling people what NOT to do grabs people’s attention because it’s a warning and we’re scared of something bad happening if we accidentally do those things."
"10 Year Gaming Setup Progression…","10 Year (Entity) Progression…","+4390","Time Frame – “10 Year” makes this video more interesting because it increases the magnitude of this change and even hints that you’re gonna get some nostalgia. Desire – This creator’s audience loves gaming setups."
"Strong Legs For Seniors (The ONLY Leg Workout You Need!) 65+","[Benefit] For [Specific Audience] (The ONLY [Activity] You Need!) [Specific Audience]","+6123","Desire – This creator’s audience wants stronger legs. Specific Audience – By calling out seniors and 65+, that group of people feels like this video was made just for them, so they’re more likely to click. Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: 1) “The ONLY” adds a constraint which makes this more interesting. 2) It opens a loop and makes you wonder what this leg workout is."
"Should you Study SPANISH Alone or in a Group? | How to Improve your Spanish: Self-study vs Groups","","-78","Bold statements often make for better titles than questions. (Question titles do better when they’re common questions everybody has asked themselves.) But by asking this question she’s excluding the people who think they don’t want to study Spanish in a group. It might’ve been better if the title was something like, “The Easiest Way To Learn Spanish FASTER.” This is a bold statement that adds curiosity and leverages desire, and gives her a chance to convince people who think they don’t want to study in a group to change their mind if they want to learn Spanish faster. (Of course, this is all assuming that it’s better to study in a group than alone.) In addition to the statement vs question bit, this title is super long and complicated.

"How I learned to draw better faces in a week","How I learned to (Achieve Goal) in a week","+446","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to get better at drawing faces. Time Frame – We all want to achieve our goals faster and “in a week” promises this video will do that."
"“What’s Coming Is WORSE Than A Recession” — Jim Rickards’ Last WARNING","“What’s Coming Is WORSE Than A (Known Bad Event)” — (Authority Figure’s) Last WARNING","+480","Negativity – Warnings do a great job of grabbing people’s attention and getting them to click. Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it opens a loop and makes you wonder what’s coming. Anchoring – We all know what a recession is, so saying “What’s Coming Is WORSE Than A Recession” makes this feel more tangible and scary. Authority – Although I don’t think this is as strong as the curiosity and negativity, Jim Rickards’s name brings some credibility and authority here. Urgency – “Last Warning” brings some urgency to this video."
"The SCAM Bagged Soil Companies Don’t Want You To Know","The SCAM (Entity or Authority) Doesn’t Want You To Know","+2162","Negativity – “SCAM” does a great job of instilling fear and getting the audience’s attention and interest (we all love hearing about a juicy scam). Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: 1) “Don’t Want You To Know” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. 2) It opens a loop and makes you want to know what the scam is. Authority – “Bagged Soil Companies” gives this title rebellious “stick it to the man” vibes."
"5 Things Successful People Do Before 8AM","5 Things (Aspirational Group) Do Before (Time or Event)","+2440","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to be successful. Plus, our culture is obsessed with morning routines. Authority – This title is more interesting because it’s about what “successful people” do. Time Frame – Consider “5 Things Successful People Do” vs. “5 Things Successful People Do Before 8AM”. The second is more interesting, right? “Before 8AM” makes this video feel more tangible and, therefore, more interesting."
"I made Princess Peach IMMUNE to Bowser","","-80","Most of the successful videos on this channel are about how the audience can improve their drawing skills. This video doesn’t follow that trend — it’s about the creator demonstrating her skills. While this may be a good topic, it might’ve gotten more views if the title and intro were positioned as a clear benefit to the audience. To avoid a flop like this on your channel, know why your audience watches your channel and deliver on that premise in every video. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Where Do NYC Cab Drivers Eat?","Where Do (People With Credibility) (Activity)?","+317","Credibility – NYC Cab Drivers have lots of credibility when it comes to living in NYC, so where they eat makes you feel like you’re learning where the real locals eat. Desire – This channel’s audience wants to know where local New Yorkers eat. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by asking a question."
"What Is Out of Style in 2024 and What to Wear Instead","What Is (Unpopular) in (Current Year) and What to (Activity) Instead","+391","Negativity – Nobody wants to wear out-of-style clothes, so this title leverages that fear. Timeliness – This video was published at the beginning of 2024 when people were considering what was in style"
"The mindset that changed my life IMMEDIATELY","The (Entity) that (Achieved Goal) IMMEDIATELY","+1111","Desire – This leverages desire two ways: 1) Many people want to change their life. 2) Speed is important to everybody, so “IMMEDIATELY” increases the desire here. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what this mindset is."
"The Most Terrifying Man of the Vietnam War","The Most Terrifying (Entity) of the (Event)","+2435","Extreme – Telling stories about extreme things, like “The Most Terrifying Man,” often make an interesting video. Negativity – People love dramatic and terrifying stories like this. Curiosity – The man’s face in the thumbnail looks pretty innocent, so the contrast between his innocent-looking face and the title builds lots of interest and curiosity."
"The Crazy Soldier that Attacked One of Hitler’s Biggest Weapons","","-88","This title is too watered down, complicated and vague. “One of Hitler’s Biggest Weapons” isn’t as cool as “Hitler’s Biggest Weapon” (read the note from the title above about being extreme). I’m not saying they need to lie and say it’s the biggest weapon, just that they might wanna take a different angle here, or consider not making this video if the idea isn’t strong enough. Plus, what is “One of Hitler’s Biggest Weapons”? Curiosity is strongest when you think you might know the answer, and it’s weakest when you definitely know the answer or have no idea what the answer is at all. It might be because I’m not really into this niche, but in this case, I have no idea what the answer is at all. Is it a person? An actual weapon? A group of people? The title and thumbnail aren’t helping me here. Here are two other angles we could take: We could use contrast: “The Low-Level Soldier Who Changed The Entire War” Or we could model the successful title above: “The Most Terrifying Mission of WW2” (I haven’t watched this video, so these may be inaccurate, but I just wanted to show you some other ways of thinking about titles.)

"5 Perennials to Plant Once that will Feed You Forever…","5 (Entities) to (Activity) Once that will (Benefit) You Forever…","+373","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This title promises a lot for a little: plant once, and get food forever."
"NBA Legends Explain Why It’s So Hard To Guard Stephen Curry At 35","(Authority Figures) Explain Why It’s So Hard To (Action)","+957","Authority – The video is more credible and interesting because it’s “NBA Legends” explaining why it’s so hard to guard Steph, not some random YouTuber’s opinion. Curiosity – There’s a bit of counterintuitiveness here because you might assume that at 35, Steph is easier to guard, but that’s not the case. Despite his age, he had a very good year this year."
"Why I stopped using Procreate","Why I stopped using (Popular Tool)","+1324","Negativity – Telling people you stopped doing something grabs people’s attention because there’s a bit of fear that if you are using Procreate, you’re doing something wrong. Authority – Procreate is one of the most popular animation tools, so stopping using it grabs people’s attention. Curiosity – There’s a bit of counterintuitiveness here because this is such a popular tool. Why would you stop using it?"
"Nobody Wanted this Hutch  I had an idea…","Nobody Wanted this (Object) I had an idea…","+2066","Curiosity – This title makes you wonder what will happen to this hutch. Negativity – “Nobody Wanted this Hutch” adds conflict and sets this video up for a great story."
"The title also doesn’t really go with what the audience likes and expects. Do they care about being a YouTuber? Do they even care about somebody else’s furniture flipping journey? Most of the titles are about benefits for the audience.","","-84","There are several potential reasons why this video flopped: Content Misfit: Most of the successful videos on this channel are 10-20 minute videos showing the audience DIY tips. This 45 minute interview doesn’t really fit what the audience likes and expects from this channel. Title: The title also doesn’t really go with what the audience likes and expects. Do they care about being a YouTuber? Do they even care about somebody else’s furniture flipping journey? Most of the titles are about benefits for the audience. Also, I know Kate Scott has a big channel, but how much interest does she actually bring here? If I were to write this title, I’d test leading with a benefit for the audience, not Katie’s name. Thumbnail: The thumbnail is similar to the title — “Katie Scott” is the most prominent thing. You probably don’t need to lead both the title and thumbnail with her name. Also, “let’s chat” is boring. I’d probably stick a benefit to the audience here, or add curiosity or fear. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Why These Popular “Christian” Worship Artists Left Christianity","Why These Popular “(Group Members)” Left (Group)","+482","Negativity – Leaving something you’re known for supporting brings a lot of drama. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: It’s counterintuitive for Christian Worship Artists (people you’d assume would be strong in their faith) to leave Christianity.



It makes you wonder why these people left Christianity. Authority – “‘Christian’ Worship Artists” are influential in the Christian community, so them leaving grabs extra attention."
"Ghost Warriors: The German Tribes That Hunted Romans | Ancient Black Ops | Odyssey","(Epic Group of People): The (Entity) That (Aggressive Action) (Other Entity)","+518","Simple Language – This title is easy to read and uses simple language. And even if you don’t know who the “Ghost Warriors” are, this still sounds cool. Negativity – There’s fear, drama, and conflict here with “Hunted Romans” and “Ancient Black Ops”."
"Horrible YouTube Advice that’s KILLING Small Channels","Horrible (Niche) Advice that’s KILLING (Beginners)","+524","Negativity – “Horrible YouTube Advice” grabs your attention because it’s so negative, and when you read this title you get a little fear because you wonder if you’ve taken some advice that might be killing your channel. Curiosity – This makes you wonder what the advice is. Beginners – By calling out “Small Channels” this title appeals to a big, but specific audience and makes them feel like this video was made specifically for them."
"9 Things Smart Men Should Not Do With Women | Stoicism","9 Things Smart (Specific Audience) Should Not Do With (Entity)","+23965","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This warning grabs the audience’s attention and gets them to click."
"I Quit…","","-75","“I Quit” videos often get loads of views because they’re full of drama and represent big milestones. But this one did significantly worse than other videos on this channel. Why? Here are my two hypotheses: First, there’s a mismatch between the title and thumbnail. In an “I Quit…” video I would expect a more raw, emotional thumbnail with the creator front and center. Instead, we get this thumbnail. If I need hope (like the thumbnail text calls out), I don’t really want to watch a video where somebody else quit. My other theory is that this title is too vague. What did he quit? He gives zero context in the title, so we can’t know if this video is relevant for us. If the title was, “I Quit Feeling Bad For Myself…” then the thumbnail would work and the people it’s relevant for would know that this video is for them.

"I Played GTA With Real Pain","I (Activity) (Entity) With Real (Negative Consequence)","+486","Negativity – People love drama and conflict and playing a game with real pain brings both of these while raising the stakes."
"I Ranked San Francisco’s BEST Neighborhoods (Tier List)","I Ranked [Entity’s] BEST [Possession] (Tier List)","+500","Desire – People love tier lists and this creator’s audience is into San Franscisco’s best Neighborhoods."
"Lamborghini’s NEW Active Alignment is Revolutionary!","(Entity’s) NEW (Invention) is Revolutionary!","+592","Timeliness – People love news and new things and this feels like both. Desire – This creator’s audience is into all things fast cars."
"How to AVOID Getting ROBBED by PICKPOCKETS","How to AVOID (Big, Common Fear)","+608","Negativity – This title is all about the audience avoiding one of their biggest, most common fears."
"Cheaper Than JDM: Great British Cars To Import Now","","-87","This title is hard to understand and not that exciting. I’m not a car guy, but I know exactly what “Lamborghini’s NEW Active Alignment is Revolutionary!” (the title featured above from this same channel) means and I like Lamborghinis. I don’t know what JDM means and I’m not all that excited about great British cars because none easily come to mind. Again, I’m not a car guy, but if you want lots of views, you need to use simple language that lots of people easily understand and talk about topics that are interesting. Here are some of the other titles they’ve tried (thanks ​CreatorML​): Great British Cars the US Can Finally Have!



Cheaper Than JDM: Great British Cars to Import Now!



Never Sold In the US: 5 Great British Cars



Cheaper Than JDM: 5 Great British Cars It seems like “British cars” might not be the best phrase to go with here. They could go more broad and instead of focusing on the fact that these are British cars, emphasize that they’re exclusive and new to the US. Something like, “Classic Supercars Forbidden In The US”. But the thumbnail shows a cheap price tag, which doesn’t really fit with the title above. So they could either change the thumbnail to have text that goes with the title above, or they could change the title to go with the thumbnail text. Something like, “5 Affordable Classic Cars You’re Ignoring”. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The BEST A.I. Passive Income Side Hustle 2024","The BEST (Trending Activity To Achieve Goal) (Current Year)","+449","Desire – This creator’s audience would love a passive income side hustle. Timeliness – This title uses timeliness two ways: It was published in the beginning of 2024, so dropping “2024” in the title grabs the audience’s attention.



It includes all the trending buzzwords: A.I., Passive Income, and Side Hustle. I also love that this title is a bold and extreme statement — The BEST Side Hustle."
"Notion’s New Calendar App is a Game-Changer","(Company)’s New (Tool) is a Game-Changer","+456","Timeliness – People love new things. Curiosity – “Game-Changer” works so well because it adds to the desire, but it’s vague, so it makes you want to know what’s so cool about the app."
"50 Easy Habits That Will Change Your Life Forever","50 (Desirable) Habits That Will Change Your Life Forever","+595","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience (and most people, really) would love to change their life forever. “Easy” in the title and “Tiny” in the thumbnail also add to the desire because it makes these habits seem easy. Curiosity – “Change Your Life Forever” (like Game-Changer above) adds to the desire, but is open-ended, so it let’s your mind run wild with whatever you want, while also wondering what he’ll talk about in the video. Habits – “Habits” is one of the most frequent words I see in successful YouTube titles."
"How Much Can I Expect To Spend In Retirement with a $2 Million Portfolio?","How Much Can I Expect To (Activity) In (Specific Situation) with (Asset)?","+609","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question many people in this creator’s audience are asking themselves. Specific Audience – If somebody has a $2 Million Retirement Portfolio (or it’s their goal — which is probably more likely), they’re way more likely to click this video than just a generic “How How Much Can I Expect To Spend In Retirement?” video."
"How EGGS Protect, Nourish, and Heal the Brain! Dr. Mandell","","-82","Typically, more people want to know what helps you achieve your goals, rather than how they do it. You don’t need to know how eggs help your brain to enjoy the benefits of eating eggs. Here are a few different angles this creator could’ve taken for this title: He could’ve added some curiosity and made the audience wonder what food he was talking about: “The BEST Breakfast Food To Protect & Nourish Your Brain In 2024” Here’s another way he could’ve added curiosity: “Protect & Heal Your Brain By Eating This For Breakfast Every Day” Or he could’ve gone the negative route: “Big Mistakes Everybody Makes When Cooking Eggs” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Most Ridiculous Fake Minecraft Speedruns EVER","The Most Ridiculous Fake (Entities) EVER","+306","Curiosity – “Fake” makes this video intriguing. Extreme – “Most Ridiculous Fake Minecraft Speedruns EVER” grabs your attention more than, say, “Pretty Ridiculous Fake Minecraft Speedruns”"
"I bought an abandoned home.. want a tour?","I bought an abandoned (Entity).. want a tour?","+358","Negativity – Abandoned homes are creepy, so title brings a little bit of fear here. Curiosity – This does a great job of starting a story and leaving you wanting to know more because it’s counterintuitive to buy an abandoned home instead of a nice ho Milestone – Milestones, like buying a home, often make for great videos."
"This New Camera Turns EVERYTHING Into A Movie","This New (Tool) Turns EVERYTHING Into (Cool End Result)","+582","Desire – This creator’s audience likes new cameras and they want to make videos that look like movies. Curiosity – This builds curiosity by not telling you what the camera is. Timeliness – People love new things."
"My Worst Mistakes Learning Japanese (7 Years to JLPT N1)","My Worst Mistakes Learning [Activity] ([Time Frame] to [Achievement])","+5666","Negativity – Nobody wants to make mistakes, so this title grabs the audience’s attention. Authority – This creator casually shows he’s an expert by dropping “JLPT N1” in the title (this is the highest level of the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test). Time Frame – “7 Years” shows you how long and hard he’s worked at learning Japanese, which builds trust and credibility."
"Palisades Tahoe, CA Review: Better with the Gondola?","","-89","The first title in this email (“World’s Longest Ski Run”) did so well because it was cool and extreme. “Palisades Tahoe, CA Review” is so bland in comparison. If you’re talking about something specific, like a review of a Tahoe mountain, it can often help to give that thing a broadly appealing and broadly understood label. Going back to the first video in this email as an example, you might not know or care what Vallée Blanche is, but if you ski, you definitely care and know what they mean by “World’s Longest Ski Run”. If I were rewriting this title, I’d try to find some sort of extreme label, like, “America’s Longest Ski Run,” or “America’s Most Dangerous Ski Run.” If you can’t find an interesting angle about a topic, it may not be worth making a video about it.

Then He Disappeared From (Entity).","+421","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: 1) It’s counterintuitive that the league’s best hitter would disappear from baseball. 2) This does a great job at starting a story, but not finishing it. Why did he disappear from baseball? Negativity – Disappearing from baseball brings a bit of drama to this title. Authority – “League’s Best Hitter” grabs the audience’s attention."
"Your Heartbreak Will Get Better the Moment You Watch This","Your (Problem) Will Get Better the Moment You Watch This","+477","Desire – This creator’s audience wants their heartbreak to get better fast, and this title promises exactly that. Negativity – This is all about a big problem the audience faces: heartbreak."
"What Happens if You SURFACE LAY Potatoes Instead of BURY?","What Happens if You (Unexpected Action) Instead of (Expected Action)?","+593","Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it’s counterintuitive to lay potatoes on top of the soil instead of burying them in it."
"I tried this mind-blowing ancient Japanese technique","I tried this mind-blowing ancient (Culture) technique","+12537","Authority – “Ancient Japanese” grabs the audience’s attention and builds trust that this is a cool and effective technique. Curiosity – This opens a loop because it makes you wonder what the technique is and how the creator went from dirt on the left side of the thumbnail to the smooth, round ball on the right. Epic – “Mind-blowing” and “ancient Japanese” make this title feel epic."
"Are you having a complicated Christmas?","","-78","This title flopped for a few reasons. First, do you know what this video is about? Or who it’s for? It’s too vague. Keywords are often a debated topic when it comes to YouTube titles, but in this case, this title could use some keywords. Not necessarily for the algorithm, but just for the audience to know what the video is about. Also, this video was published on December 24th. Christmas is the very next day, so this video is irrelevant after that because people aren’t thinking about Christmas anymore. I’m all for trying to ride trends and current events, but this probably isn’t a strong and broad enough trend and they didn’t publish it early enough to make the most of the event. Plus, the majority of this channel’s content is evergreen, so they might’ve been better off spending their time making another evergreen video that addresses their audience’s timeless hopes, dreams, and fears.

"World’s Fastest Camera Drone Vs F1 Car (ft. Max Verstappen)","World’s (Extreme Attribute) (Object) Vs (Standard of Attribute)","+535","Desire – This channel’s audience loves speed. Extreme – People love extreme things, like “World’s Fastest Camera Drone”. Curiosity – Pitting two things against each other builds curiosity because you want to know which will win. Authority – Dropping Max Verstappen’s name (the current F1 champion) grabs the audience’s attention and lets them know this isn’t just any F1 driver in this video, it’s the best."
"Why “Shot On iPhone” Commercials Look So Good! Ft. Claudio Miranda","Why (Surprising Thing Happens)","+709","Curiosity – This title promises to answer a question that so many people have asked themselves. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to make better-looking videos."
"3 STYLE TIPS TO AVOID LOOKING OLDER AND OUTDATED OVER 50","3 (Niche) Tips To Avoid (Unwanted Attribute) (Specific Audience)","+1968","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This title is all about avoiding pain, rather than getting pleasure. Specific Audience – This specifically calls out people over 50, which makes people over 50 feel like this video was made for them (which makes them more likely to click)."
"The Only Way To Brace A Gate","The Only Way To (Activity or Achieve Goal)","+16867","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: 1) It opens a loop because it makes you want to know which way is the only way. 2) “The Only Way” adds a constraint that makes this video more bold and interesting. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn how to brace a gate."
"CLEAN YOUR CAMERA SENSOR without RUINING YOUR CAMERA!","","-84","I actually like this title. I love refuting objections, like how they did with “without Ruining Your Camera” here. However, it seems like that wasn’t enough to get lots of people to click. So what could they have done better? Here’s my question: how many people are actually interested in cleaning their camera sensor? And of those people, how many care enough to watch a video about it? I’m not into photography, so I don’t know the answer, but based on the performance of this video, it seems like it might not be that many people. That doesn’t mean cleaning your camera sensor isn’t important though. To get more people interested in this video, they could’ve gone broader in the title and positioned it as a benefit or leveraged fear: The 3-Minute Hack To Make Your Photography Instantly Better (benefit-driven)



This Simple Mistake Is Ruining Your Photography (fear-driven) Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Fastest Way to $10,000 a Month with Coding in 2024","Fastest Way to (Specific Goal) with (Opportunity) in (Current Year)","+414","Desire – Not only does this creator’s audience wants to make $10,000/month, but they’d also love to do it the fastest way. People love speed. Timeliness – This video was published in January of 2024, when everybody was feeling excited and hopeful about the new year. Dropping “in 2024” at the end of the title grabs people’s attention and lets them know this is relevant right now."
"I Should NOT Have Done This!","I Should NOT Have (Activity) This!","+448","Curiosity – This title and thumbnail open a loop because they make you want to know how he got himself in this predicament (and how he’s gonna get himself out). Negativity – People love drama and this title and thumbnail have a lot of it. I typically like to be a bit more descriptive in my titles (you don’t need “keywords”, but you do need to tell your audience what your video is about). However, the thumbnail is so descriptive and drama-filled that it gets the job done."
"Why Tolkien Hated Disney","Why (Authority Figure) Hated (Other Authority Figure)","+1155","Negativity – This title promises a lot of drama. Authority – This gets the audience’s attention and is more interesting because it’s about J. R. R. Tolkien and Walt Disney, two of the biggest names in entertainment. Curiosity – Since these are two of the biggest names in entertainment, you would probably assume that they would have a mutual respect for one another, but this title says otherwise."
"Carnivore Dieters: This Cut of Meat Will Save You Lots Of Money","(Specific Group): This (Object) Will (Help You Achieve Goal)","+2330","Specific Audience – This grabs the attention of a specific group of people (carnivore dieters) and makes them more likely to click. Desire – Most people would love to save lots of money. Curiosity – This title opens a loop because it makes you want to know what cut of meat this is. Timeliness – This title rides the growing trend of carnivore diets. Here’s an interesting screenshot that shows keto diet and carnivore diet actually get the same number of searches these days:"
"My Life Through Knives: A Butcher Wizard History","","-96","The video about Carnivore Dieters above (from this same channel) was all about the audience, but this one is all about the creator. Besides that, this title is vague and bland. What does “my life through knives” even mean? The goal of this video was for the creator to share his story, and he still could’ve done that even while positioning the video as a benefit to the audience. Something like, “The One Kitchen Knife Everyone Needs To Own.” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"What Your Favorite Exotic PRIMARY Says About YOU (Destiny 2)","What Your Favorite (Tool) Says About YOU","+356","Desire – Everybody likes to learn about themselves and this video is a fun way to do that. Negativity – The thumbnail grabs attention with a bold, negative statement."
"Jacksonville’s FASTEST Selling Master Planned Community [eTown Jacksonville Fl]","(Entity’s) (Extreme Action) (Possession)","+475","Desire – This creator’s audience is looking for good, fast-selling communities to live in in Jacksonville. Extreme – Taking things to the extreme (ex: “FASTEST Selling”) is a cool, interesting way to say these houses are selling fast and this is a good neighborhood."
"What the heck happened to the RV industry?","What the heck happened to the (Niche) industry?","+542","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question. Negativity – People love drama and conflict, and this simple question brings a lot of that. Confirms Suspicions – This works so well because people are already suspicious of the RV industry."
"The 5 Phases of Minimalism","The 5 Phases of (Journey)","+719","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience loves learning and talking about minimalism."
"RV dealers: How to find one you can trust","","-89","This title could use some sprucing up. Let’s get it a shot. “How To Find Trustworthy RV Dealers In 2024” It’s the beginning of the year, so dropping 2024 is a great way to grab attention. This style of title is great to rank in search, but if we’re mostly going for browse or suggested traffic (which has more potential traffic, but typically less buyer intent), we could add curiosity or negativity, like: “The One Question to ask an RV Dealer BEFORE you buy from them” “5 Warning Signs of a Bad RV Dealer” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"I made $3,995/Week with Basic Canva Clip Art – Here’s How","I (Achieved Specific Goal) with (Simple Tool) – Here’s How","+607","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to earn $3,995 a week. This title also uses the “a lot for a little” concept: earning $3,995/week is a lot, but “Basic Canva Clip Art” is a little. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: 1) There’s contrast between $3,995 and “Basic Canva Clip Art” (the “a lot for a little” concept builds both desire and curiosity). 2) It opens a loop because “Here’s How” invites you in and makes you want to know how."
"URGENT: Do Not File Your Tax Return Yet (wait until Jan. 29th)","URGENT: Do Not [Activity With Upcoming Deadline] Yet (wait until [Specific Date])","+625","Negativity – This title is a warning that works great to grab people’s attention and get them to click. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder why you should wait until Jan. 29th. Timeliness – The timing of this video was perfect since it was published two weeks before the January 29th deadline and at a time when people start to think about filing taxes."
"Flying First Class to Every Continent in 7 days","(Fancy Activity) Every (Entity) in (Short Time Frame)","+702","Epic – This is a fancy, epic challenge. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to fly first class to every continent. Time Frame – “in 7 days” makes this video more tangible, challenging, and interesting."
"Apple Glasses Release Date and Price – FORGET VISION PRO! Wait for APPLE GLASSES!!","(Upcoming Trending Product) – FORGET (Currently Trending Product)! Wait for (Upcoming Trending Product)!!","+749","I don’t love “Apple Glasses Release Date and Price” in the beginning of this title — it feels like generic keyword stuffing to me. However, there are a few things I like: Curiosity – “Forget Vision Pro” is counterintuitive because the Vision Pro is the coolest thing out right now, should you really forget about it? Timeliness – This video is riding the wave of the Apple Vision Pro’s popular release. Desire – This creator’s audience loves cool tech like the Vision Pro and Apple Glasses."
"15 Genius Printify Hacks In Under 10 Minutes","","-85","I actually like this title, but two things could be better: First, the thumbnail text just repeats the title. This is wasting an opportunity to try another angle to get the viewer to click. If it were me, I’d show one of the tips and tricks, or an outcome or benefit from one of them. The second issue is that it seems like it might be too specific. The video featured in this newsletter earlier was about Canva tips, but Canva is so much more popular than Printify. Here’s a screenshot from Google Trends comparing the search volume of Canva vs. Printify: This creator has had a few successful videos about Printify, but they all seem to be search-based videos published a few years ago, while this has more of a browse-friendly title. If it were me, I’d either double down on search (something like, “How To Make Money With Printify In 2024”) or be more broad. I’d do this by talking about making money in general, instead of talking specifically about one tool, like Printify (ex: “10 Genius Side Hustle Ideas In 10 Minutes”).

"You have a B2 Level in French If You Know These Words – Advanced French Vocabulary","You Have A (Achievement Level) In (Niche) If You (Accomplishment)","+315","Curiosity – This title opens a loop because it makes you want to know what “These Words” are. It also issues a challenge that makes you want to know what level you are. Desire – People love learning about themselves and this title leverages that well here. It kinda feels like a smarter version of those “Which Hogwarts house would you be in?” quizzes that everybody loved."
"Best 3 Free Image Upscalers in 2024 + Comparison","Best 3 Free (Tools) In (Current Year)","+338","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience loves image upscalers and everybody loves free things. (Plus, free things attract a bigger audience.) Timeliness – This video was published on December 30th, when everybody was thinking about 2024."
"Using Apple Vision Pro: What It’s Actually Like!","Using (New Product): What It’s Actually Like!","+550","Curiosity – The contrast of ad vs. reality in the thumbnail is so good here and it makes you wonder what this crazy new product is actually like. Plus, the word “actually” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Timeliness – Everybody is currently talking about the Apple Vision Pro and this creator did a great job riding that wave. Desire – This creator’s audience loves new tech and this is right up their alley."
"It’s Begun! The Car Market CRASH of 2024","It’s Begun! The (Negative Event) of (Current Year)","+1788","Timeliness – “It’s Begun” makes this feel like something just started, and people love news like this. Also, dropping “2024” in the title with this being published in January of 2024 helps reinforce that feeling. Negativity – “The Car Market CRASH” brings drama and fear to this title."
"How to Speak French like a Lady From Versailles ? She’s teaching me!","","-70","I don’t speak French and I don’t care to speak like a Lady from Versailles, so maybe I don’t get it… but this title feels way too niche compared to the rest of the videos on this channel about learning French. If it were me, I’d probably skip this topic and focus on more broadly appealing topics, like tips and mistakes of speaking current-day French. But since she already made this video, we could try another angle to write the title. Since the thumbnail is about the right way to cuss, we could follow that angle for the title and write something like: How To Curse Like A Versailles Queen



Forbidden Words You Couldn’t Say In 18th Century France (I don’t particularly love these, I’d need to work them some more, but this is just an example of how you can go from broad and boring to specific and spicy.)

"11 Money-Saving Household Tricks – Don’t throw these out!","11 (Precious Resource)-Saving (Niche) Tricks – (Warning)","+712","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants tricks to save money. Negativity – This title finishes off with a warning which makes people even more likely to click because they don’t want to accidentally throw something out that they shouldn’t. Curiosity – “Don’t throw these out!” builds opens a loop because you don’t know what “these” are."
"Seven Steps To Get In The Best Shape Of Your Life In 2024 | Mind Pump 2227","Seven Steps To (Achieve Big Goal) In (Upcoming Year)","+835","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to get in the best shape of their life. Note that this video isn’t just about getting in great shape, but specifically “the best shape of your life”, which sounds so much cooler and tangible than just great shape. Timeliness – This video was published at the end of 2023 when 2024 was on everybody’s mind. The New Year is a time when people start to think about getting in shape the most, which also helped this video get so many views."
"My Lesson With Tiger Woods EX-Coach Is Going To BLOW YOUR MIND!","My Lesson With (Authority Figure’s) EX-Coach Is Going To Blow Your Mind!","+862","Authority – You automatically trust and desire the information in this video because it’s from the greatest golfer of all time’s old coach. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to get their mind blown with helpful golf tips. Curiosity – The thumbnail text opens a loop because it makes you wonder what he’s teaching him that’s so genius, so you have to click."
"If You Want To Know How a Man Feels About You, Try THIS!","If You Want To Know (Information), Try THIS!","+1177","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to know how men feel about them. Curiosity – “Try THIS” opens a loop because it makes you want to know what “THIS” is, so you have to click."
"This Chipping Technique Is So EASY And It Really Works!","","-76","This title and thumbnail aren’t that bad, but I think they could be better. Here are a few things I’d change: “It Really Works” is too vague and weak. What does it work for? Give me a juicy benefit that I’ll get using this chipping technique. Or show me that it really works, don’t tell me. Also, I don’t love using the word “And” in titles because it dilutes the focus and power of the title. Here are a few other options for a title: “The Perfect Chipping Technique To Never Land In The Bunker”



“This Weird Chipping Tip Will Change Your Golf Game Forever”



“If You’re Sick of Chipping Into The Bunker, Try THIS” (Note that the original title has a positive angle, but some of the other options I suggested try curiosity or negativity. If one emotion doesn’t work very well, it can often be worth trying other emotions.) Another issue is that the title and thumbnail text are too similar: “simple” in the thumbnail and “easy” in the title pretty much reaffirm the same point. If it were me I’d either try a different benefit in the thumbnail text or try to add some curiosity or negativity. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Watching Her Paint Will Change How You See Art!","Watching Her (Activity) Will Change How You See (Entity)!","+433","Curiosity – This opens a loop because it makes you wonder what it is about how she paints that will make such an impact on you. Epic – “Change How You See Art” is so powerful because it’s epic and vague (which also adds to the curiosity)."
"Ranking the BEST Seed Companies in 2024? (#1 Shocked Me)","Ranking the BEST [Products or Product Providers] in 2024? (#1 Shocked Me)","+1096","Desire – People love rankings (and this creator’s audience loves s. Timeliness – This video uses “2024” in the title and was published in late December, right before the new year, when everybody was thinking about 2024. Curiosity – (#1 Shocked Me) builds curiosity because it makes you wonder what #1 is. I don’t love this type of curiosity building — it feels a bit forced and clickbaity, and reminds me of 2014 BuzzFeed articles — but I feel like I’ve been seeing this a bit more recently."
"Make in a Day Crochet Chunky Blanket ! So EASY","Make in a Day (Object) ! So EASY [Relevant Emojis]","+1192","I wouldn’t necessarily model this title exactly how it is because I don’t like how it’s worded (although “make in a day crochet” videos are popular in this niche), but there are two things we can learn from it that make this title so effective: Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn how to make a chunky blanket and this desire is heightened even more because it’s “So EASY”. Time Frame – The time frame of “Make in a Day” makes this video feel more tangible and easy, and these two also increase the desire."
"Marcus Aurelius’ Advice if you’re tired of life","(Authority Figure)’s Advice if you’re (Experiencing a Problem)","+1929","Authority & Desire – This creator’s audience respects Marcus Aurelius and wants to hear his opinion. Negativity – This title calls out people in pain. If this was about “Marcus Aurelius’ Advice if you’re happy as a clam,” it probably wouldn’t do as well because those people wouldn’t be looking for help."
"Timothy Denevi on Hunter S Thompson and the Art of Journalism","","-96","This video was published right before the video above that got 1.1M views — so why did this only get 7.8K? First off, the title is pretty meh. In the Marcus Aurelius video, it makes sense to drop his name because he’s so famous. But Timothy Denevi? I don’t know much about this niche, so maybe I’m unaware, but I don’t think his name brings that much attention. Even Hunter S Thompson might not have enough name recognition to justify using his name in the title. And “the Art of Journalism” is a little bland. It might do better to add some drama, fear, curiosity, or desire into this title. Something like: The Moment Journalism Changed History



This Is The Only True Shortcut In Life Ok, bland title aside — there’s a big strategy question we need to ask ourselves: Should full podcast episodes be on the same channel as talking head videos, video essays, and podcast clips? It seems like the best channels have one format/video length. MrBeast is all 15-20 minute entertainment videos, Diary of a CEO is all 2-hour long interview videos. If I ran this channel, I’d probably have a separate channel for interviews like this one. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Bible Verse That Spiritually Throat-Punched Me.","The (Object) That (Drastic Action) Me.","+522","Negativity – “Throat-Punched” and the thumbnail text, “Contradicted Everything” brings some drama here. Plus, “throat-punched” is such visual language that it increases this dramatic feeling. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you wonder what this bible verse is. There’s also contrast between “bible verse” and “throat-punched me”, which builds even more curiosity."
"Photographers Who Got Caught Cheating","(Group of People) Who Got Caught Cheating","+527","Negativity – People love drama and this title promises a lot of it. Curiosity – The thumbnail makes you wonder what’s circled and what somebody did to cheat in this photo, so you’ve got to click to find out."
"7 Mistakes Beginners Make Camping in Cold/Winter Weather","7 Mistakes Beginners Make (Activity) in (Hard and/or Current Circumstances)","+577","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This title leverages people’s fear of making mistakes. Plus, it’s about a difficult time to camp — “7 Mistakes Beginners Make Camping In Beautiful Weather” probably wouldn’t do as well. Beginners – Calling out beginners works so well because beginners are the biggest subset of any audience and they’re usually the most eager to learn. Timeliness – This video was published at the beginning of winter when camping in cold/winter weather was on everyone’s mind."
"STOP Throwing Away Aerosol Spray Cans With No AIR! How To Recharge, Save And Fix It! DIY","STOP (Common Thing)! How To (Achieve Goal)","+2153","Negativity – This title starts with a warning against doing something most people do. Curiosity – It’s counterintuitive to stop throwing away empty aerosol spray cans. They don’t have any air, so of course you should throw them away, right? Desire – This title finishes by helping the audience get something they want."
"What I Found in One of the Smallest Countries in the World","","-85","There are a few things this creator could’ve done to make this packaging better: The biggest opportunity is to make the thumbnail and title work better together. The title sparks a question (“What did he find?”), but it feels like the thumbnail answers it with the image of the big furry bull/yak thing. In the “Photographers Who Got Caught Cheating” thumbnail above, there’s a little circle that the creator is pointing to that makes you say, “What’s that?” This creator could’ve done something similar. Instead of having the bull/yak, there could’ve been an arrow pointing to the city with text like, “So Weird” or something to make you wonder what he found. The title also could’ve been a little punchier. I don’t like using “one of the” in titles. Extreme things work well on YouTube and “one of the” waters that down. Instead, I try to make something the most extreme in its category. In this title, instead of “One of the Smallest Countries in the World”, I would’ve said “Europe’s Smallest Country”. If that doesn’t make sense or isn’t true, then I’d either try to put it in a different category or try a different angle. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"90 Year Olds Share Advice for Their Younger Self","(Experienced People) Share Advice For Their (Past Selves)","+410","Curiosity – The thumbnail text builds curiosity because many people assume getting married is good, but this old guy says don’t do it, so it’s counterintuitive. Plus, he’s with a woman who you would assume is his wife, which builds even more curiosity. Negativity – The thumbnail text is a warning and people love warnings. Credibility – This has credibility because 90-year-olds have lots of life experience. Plus, sharing advice for their “younger selves”. Desire – Everybody loves to hear advice from old people to their younger selves."
"First 10 Things To Do – Samsung Galaxy ONE UI6 ( tips and tricks )","First 10 Things To Do – [New Product] ( tips and tricks )","+850","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants tips and tricks for their new Galaxy ONE. Beginners – Calling out the “first” things to do works so well because people who just got a new phone are excited to see all it can do."
"I Cooked 100 Years of School Lunch","I (Activity) 100 Years of (Object)","+2500","Curiosity – The contrast of the old and new lunches builds curiosity. Time Frame – 100 Years of lunches makes this video more tangible, and therefore, more interesting. Epic – 100 Years makes this video feel big and epic."
"Luxury Fashion Is For Broke People","(Extreme Thing) Is For (Opposite Extreme)","+40740","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: There’s contrast between “luxury fashion” and “broke people”.



It’s counterintuitive that luxury fashion is for broke people. Negativity – There’s a bit of drama and controversy here by saying luxury fashion is for broke people."
"Why People Struggle to Say ‘I Love You’","","-84","When people ask me what makes a good YouTube title, I always say it’s about these 3 emotions: Curiosity



Fear



Desire You know what’s not on this list? Sadness. I’ve broken down almost 1,000 YouTube titles in this newsletter over the years and sadness has probably appeared in less than 5 titles (whereas the other 3 emotions have appeared in 400-600 titles). If I were to rewrite this packaging, I’d probably leave the title, but try to swap out sadness for drama or fear in the thumbnail text. Something like, “It’s my biggest regret”.

"Rockefeller: The World’s First Billionaire","(Person): The World’s First (Milestone Achiever)","+375","Extreme – “The World’s Second Billionaire” is a lot less cool than the world’s first. Extreme things, like the biggest, fastest, cheapest, or first, make for much more interesting topics. Epic – “World’s First” and “Billionaire” make this video feel epic. Authority – A lot of people know Rockefeller’s name, which helps grab extra attention."
"I Spent a Day in Haiti’s Most Dangerous Slum","I Spent a Day in (Entity’s) Most Dangerous (Place)","+412","Negativity – This title leverages fear to get people to click. Extreme – “Most Dangerous Slum” is a lot cooler and more epic than, say, “A Pretty Dangerous Slum”. Time Frame – Spending a day here makes this video feel more tangible, which makes it more interesting."
"How Do Portland Residents Feel About Living in Portland Oregon?","How Do (Group of People) Feel About (Their Current Choice or Activity)?","+416","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question. Desire – This works well because this creator’s audience is considering moving to Portland. Credibility – This has credibility because it’s about how real residents feel about living in Portland, not visitors or a realtor trying to sell you on living in Portland."
"Why I Don’t Own A House as a Multi-Millionaire…","Why I Don’t (Expected Action) as a (Person Who Would Do Expected Action)…","+751","Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it’s counterintuitive. You would expect a multi-millionaire to own a house. Negativity – The thumbnail piles on the drama and fear and the rent vs. buy argument is a controversial one that a lot of people have strong opinions about. Credibility – Since this creator is a multi-millionaire he brings more credibility to this argument."
"9 Features Riot NEEDS to add to Valorant in 2024","","-82","I don’t play Valorant, so this might just be me, but this thumbnail doesn’t scream “this is a cool Valorant video.” It’s kinda like keywords in titles. You don’t always need them for the algorithm, but you do need at least some sort of keywords (and in this case, imagery) to let your target audience know your video is about something they’re interested in. If it were me, I’d probably show one or two of the features they need to add, but in a more Valoranty way. In addition to the sus thumbnail, the title could be better. Now if this video did well I’d be telling you how great it was because it was a list and it had “2024” in the title. But this video flopped, so something went wrong, and if they don’t wanna change the thumbnail, here are a few ways to rewrite the title: They could focus on just one of the features in the title and say, “The BIGGEST Thing Valorant needs to add in 2024”



Apparently Valorant lied about adding replay, so you could frame the title around that: “Valorant Lied About This, But It Needs To Change In 2024”



The creator said Valorant is getting a little bit stale, so that could be another angle he could take: “Valorant Is Getting Stale — Here’s What Needs To Change In 2024” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Skincare Ingredients You CAN’T Mix?! | Doctorly Investigates","(Tools) You CAN’T Mix?!","+401","Negativity – This is all about warning your audience about things they shouldn’t do. Curiosity – This opens a loop and makes you want to know what ingredients they’re talking about."
"Make anyone OBSESSED with you in these 12 STEPS","(Achieve Deep Desire) in these (Number) STEPS","+406","Desire – This title speaks to a deep desire this audience has. It’s not just “Make anyone like you” it’s “Make anyone OBSESSED with you”. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"Are these words really BAD? | Arabic101","Are these (Entities) really BAD?","+465","Negativity – This is about “BAD” words, and people love bad, controversial, or taboo things. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by framing it as a question."
"10 Life-changing SELF CARE HABITS for the Highly Sensitive Person","10 Life-changing (Goal or Niche) HABITS for the (Underdog)","+841","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to change their life and they want to learn about self-care habits. Specific Audience – By calling out highly sensitive people, this title makes highly sensitive people more likely to click. And this works so well because highly sensitive people probably are more likely to watch a video about life-changing habits than, say, perfectly content people, or highly confident people."
"How To Make More Money In Your Career!","","-70","In the intro, this creator says, “I came across a question recently — somebody was asking how they can earn more than $70,000 per year.” It reminds me of one of my new favorite quotes: “Don’t listen to a customer, listen to your customers.” In this scenario, it means that if one person has a question, it might not be worth making a whole video about because it could be too small of an audience, but if a lot of people ask you the same question, then listen up because it may be a big question that many people have. I’m sure many people in this creator’s audience want to make more money, but I feel like $70,000 — the number from this specific question — just isn’t exciting enough to put in the thumbnail and intro. If it were me, I’d probably put $100,000 in the thumbnail because that feels like a big goal more people have and are really excited about hitting. Even the creator said in the intro “$70,000 today isn’t worth what it was even a year ago,” so he knows this number isn’t all that enticing. Ok, enough of me ranting about the thumbnail text. How can we make the title more exciting? Here are a few options: We could make it more specific: “How To Make Over $100,000/Year In Your Career”



We could make it more timely: “How To Make More Money In Your Career In 2024”



We could make it more tangible: “How To Make More Money In Your Career In 5 Simple Steps”



We could speak more to the audience’s desires: “How To Land Your Dream Job (While Making OVER $100,000)”



We could add more curiosity and authority: “Job Recruiter’s #1 Secret To Negotiate A Higher Salary” Deciding which one of these titles (or another) to go with really depends on your audience and the traffic source you’re targeting. Plus, you can see why it’s so important to come up with your title before you write your script because each of these titles is a different angle and, ideally, you’d reaffirm your title in the intro so the audience knows this video is right for them and they’ll keep watching.

"I Mixed Every Sports Drink & Flavor Into One Drink","I Mixed Every (Entity) Into One (Entity)","+390","Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: The word “Every” makes this video feel extreme and unique.



This does a good job at starting a story and making you want to know what will happen and what it will taste like."
"Making A Worn-Down Home Look Fancy (Even if You’re BROKE!)","Making A [Negative Description] [Entity] Look [Positive Description] (Even if You’re [Constraint]!)","+707","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to make their home look fancy. Curiosity – The contrast between “worn-down” and “fancy” builds curiosity. “Even if You’re BROKE” – These four words add so much to this title: It refutes an objection and gets rid of the excuse that you have to be rich to have a fancy-looking home.



It’s a constraint, which adds to the curiosity.



It digs at a pain point many people have."
"Clear Ketchup","(Counterintuitive or Impossible Thing)","+1238","“Clear Ketchup” was trending on TikTok, so that certainly helped this video do well. However, clear bacon, clear crisps, and clear tomato soup have all gotten loads of views for this channel without the help of TikTok, so the TikTok wave wasn’t the only reason for this video’s success. Plus, what made this trend on TikTok in the first place? The biggest thing is that it builds so much curiosity. Clear Ketchup seems impossible and challenges our assumptions of what ketchup should be like. This is also a great example of how if you have a great idea and thumbnail, your title doesn’t need to be fancy, it just needs to be clear (no pun intended)."
"When Your Game Is Bad But Your Optimisation Is Genius","When Your (Attribute) Is Bad But Your (Other Attribute) Is Genius","+16666","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: There’s contrast between bad and genius



It opens a loop because it makes you want to know what happens"
"He Makes $1M/year With 1 AirBnB","","-96","Quick disclaimer here: hindsight is 20/20, so it’s easy for me to say “This is why it didn’t work!” while sitting on my couch not actually being the one to make this video. That being said, there are two reasons why I think it flopped. The first is that it’s too specific. Many of the successful titles on this channel talk about making money without specifically saying how. If you don’t want to make money with Airbnb, putting “Airbnb” in the title automatically gives you a reason to not watch this video. Here’s another example: Being less specific (plus a few other factors) made a huge difference in views here. (Note: this heavily depends on your audience. Some channels are known for sharing specific ways people make money, but it seems like this channel is known for attracting a broader audience and being more general.) The second reason this flopped is that there’s not much curiosity or twist. The thumbnail does build some curiosity because it opens a loop and makes you wonder what “This” is (yay), but the title answers that question and removes some of the curiosity (boo). There’s also no constraint, contrast, twist, or progress like some of the other titles on this channel: Meet The Billionaire that Works a Normal Job



I Was Homeless… Now I’m Worth $250 Million



Asking A 76 Year Old Shipping Billionaire If It Was Worth It This is just a straight up title saying that he makes a lot of money with Airbnb. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"10 Dunkers vs 1 Fake","10 (Entities) vs 1 Fake","+503","Curiosity – This builds curiosity in two ways: “Fake” adds intrigue here



People love challenge videos because they make you want to know what will happen There’s also curiosity throughout the video (which made me watch until the end) because you see the contestants, and you know that 10 of them can dunk, but there were several short people. That held my attention the whole time because I wanted to see the short people dunk."
"Cybertruck Crash Test is HORRIFYING, Here’s Why","(Entity or Event) is HORRIFYING, Here’s Why","+1","Negativity – This leverages fear to get people to click. Timeliness – This video was published right around the time the Cybertruck was made available to the public. Curiosity – “Here’s Why” opens a loop and makes you want to know what happened."
"(10 MISTAKES) When Buying Land…","(10 MISTAKES) When [Activity]…","+10","Negativity – This leverages fear with “mistakes” in the title and the warning in the thumbnail. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – The thumbnail text opens a loop and makes you want to know what you should never buy."
"How to grow bitter melon in tires for families without gardens, fertilizer from beer","How to (Achieve Goal) (Unexpected Way) for (Audience with Constraint), (Counterintuitive Method)","+24","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn how to grow bitter melon. Curiosity – “fertilizer from beer” and growing melon “in tires” are both weird and counterintuitive, so they make you want to see what’s going on there. Specific Audience & Refute Objection – Calling out “families without gardens” does two things: It makes people without gardens more likely to click because they feel like this video was made specifically for them.



It gets rid of the “I can’t do this because I don’t have a garden” excuse, which also makes people more likely to click."
"Match The Race To The Person","","-75","The obvious reason this flopped is that every video on this channel is about sports except for this one. It seemed like they tried to go broader here and it didn’t work that well. However, there are still a few other things that worked against this idea: There’s less curiosity for the viewer in the thumbnail. It’s obvious which one is white, but with the fake dunker video above, the audience doesn’t know which is fake.



There’s not much drama or intrigue in the title. They could’ve used the same framework above and went with an idea like “10 White People vs 1 Fake”. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"You’ll Never Go Back To Your Old Turkey Method After This","You’ll Never Go Back To Your Old (Activity or Thing) Method After This","+515","Timeliness – This video was published two weeks before Thanksgiving when people were looking for turkey recipes. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to cook a delicious turkey for Thanksgiving. New Opportunity – Giving people a new way to do something is exciting and gives people hope for a better outcome in the future. The title implies a new opportunity, and the thumbnail shows an unexpected turkey presentation. Curiosity – This opens a loop because you want to know what this new turkey method is."
"things i was ~influenced~ to buy that i lowkey regret (deinfluencing you)","[Products] i was ~influenced~ to [Action] that i lowkey regret (deinfluencing you)","+563","Negativity – Regret is such a negative and emotional word that people can’t help but click. Plus, this is all about a negative experience with influencers. Curiosity – Lists of negative things build a lot of curiosity because you want to know what products she’s going to talk about."
"The GOAT of camp gadgets just got a MAJOR upgrade","The GOAT of (Activity or Niche) gadgets just got a MAJOR upgrade","+665","Desire – This creator’s audience loves camping gadgets. Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it makes you want to know what the gadget is and what the upgrade is. Timeliness – “just” makes this feel like news and people love news."
"Touring the RICHEST City in Texas | SOUTHLAKE Texas Complete Tour 2024 | Living in Southlake Texas","Touring the (Extreme Adjective) (Entity) in (Entity) | (Keywords) (Current Year)","+916","Extreme – Putting things in buckets and making them the most extreme in that bucket, like “the RICHEST City in Texas”, is a great way to make topics interesting and unique. Timeliness – He dropped the upcoming year in there to let his audience know this is relevant right now. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to hear about beautiful Texas neighborhoods."
"Batman Makes A Bat-Burger","","-88","My first thought when I saw this title was, “They broke the #1 rule of writing titles: be clear, not clever.” But then I watched the video. This title isn’t trying to be clever, they really did a skit where the creator dressed up as Batman and made a burger. It was published a few days before Halloween, so this was how they celebrated. Most of the commenters loved it, so if you’re trying to entertain your core audience, then this could be a fun idea to remember for next year. But if you’re trying to get the most views possible, here are 2 lessons we can take from this video: If you want to have fun and showcase your personality, it’s best to sprinkle it into your normal content while giving your audience what they want and expect from your channel, instead of totally mixing it up.



Be clear, not clever (when I first clicked this video, I wasn’t sure what I was going to get… although as it turned out, it was clear, I just wasn’t sure what to expect). All that being said, there’s more to YouTube than just views, so take this with a grain of salt and know what your goals are for every video you publish.

"Can I Beat The World’s FASTEST 9 Year Old Parkrunner?","Can I Beat The World’s (Extreme Adjective) (Young) (Person)?","+638","Curiosity – This builds curiosity four ways: It asks a question



It’s a challenge and makes you want to know the result



There’s contrast between this big adult and small kid, which makes the challenge more interesting



Since this kid is the “FASTEST 9 Year Old Parkrunner,” he’s unique and extreme"
"The CORRECT iPhone Camera Settings for Amazing Photos – UPDATED for 2023","The CORRECT (Tool) Settings for (End Result) – UPDATED for (Current Year)","+674","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to take amazing photos. Bold Statement – I love how this title is about “the CORRECT” camera settings. Bold statements like this work well on for getting people’s attention and getting them to click. Timeliness – Dropping the current year in here grabs the audience’s attention. One interesting note is that this video has “2023” in the title. If it were me, I’d have probably waited a few weeks to publish this video and put “2024” in the title since this was published so close to the end of 2023 (it was published October 24, 2023)."
"5 ways to animate FASTER","5 ways to (Activity) FASTER","+1075","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – You might be thinking this hook is too simple, but speed is one of the biggest desires across almost all niches. Everybody wants to reach their goals or do something faster."
"How Archimedes Almost Broke Math with Circles","How (Authority Figure) Almost Broke (Entity) with (Unexpected Entity)","+192929","Negativity – There’s drama here with “Almost Broke Math”. Curiosity – This title is counterintuitive — it’s not possible to break math, right? And almost breaking something unbreakable (math) with something so simple (circles) has a bit of contrast. Authority – Dropping Archimedes’ name gives credibility to this title. Btw, I asked ​Ben​, the creator of this video, about how he came up with the title and here’s what he said: “An earlier draft was “How the Area of a Circle Almost Broke Math.” After showing a draft of the thumbnail to a friend, I realized that the video needed to be not just about circles but also about Archimedes, so I changed the title and built out the script accordingly. It was my first time really trying to do title and thumbnail first, and in this case, getting clarity on the title/thumbnail combo really gave me a lot of clarity on the direction that the video needed to go. I didn’t realize that would happen, but it’s sold me on the idea of starting with the title and thumbnail!”"
"The Pink iPhone 15 – Unboxing & First Impressions","","-81","Let’s take a look at this creator’s channel: What sticks out to you? The Pink iPhone, right? Everything else is gray, black, or toned down. Sticking out in a crowd is often a great strategy to get views, but sticking out amongst your own content is not. It seems like his audience just isn’t into this aesthetic. I’m assuming his channel is mostly guys who aren’t into pink iPhones. To avoid this mistake it pays to know your audience well.

"I Ate Nothing But Dollar Store Food For 72 Hours","I (Activity) Nothing But (Undesirable Thing) For (Time Frame)","+529","Time Frame – The time frame of “72 Hours” makes this challenge feel more tangible and difficult. Negativity – Nobody wants to eat nothing but Dollar Store Food. Constraint – The constraint of only eating Dollar Store food makes this video more interesting. Curiosity – The contrast between the fancy suit and the ribeye in the thumbnail and the Dollar Store builds curiosity."
"Be gentle with Apples new Titanium iPhone 15 Pro Max … Yikes!","Be (Adjective) with (Company)’s new (Product) … Yikes!","+641","One of the biggest rules in writing good titles is “be clear, not clever.” This title may be toeing that line, but it works because it’s a fun way to show something is fragile, instead of saying it (which is typically much more powerful). Curiosity – This title builds curiosity because it makes you want more details about why you need to be gentle with it and why the creator said, “Yikes!” There’s also contrast between “be gentle” and “Titanium”. Negativity – This is a warning and hints that this product is not as good as you might think. Timeliness – This video was published the day after this phone was released, so everybody was eager for news about it."
"The New King of Fried Chicken?! ($1,000 Startup)","The New King of [Entity]?! ([Accessible Description])","+691","New – People love news and new things, and this title leads with “New”. Desire – The thumbnail gets the audience excited with “$250,000 Per Month” and the title makes it feel more accessible with “$1,000 Startup”. Curiosity – This thumbnail builds curiosity by asking a question."
"Farmer Exposes Behind the Scenes Food Industry Scandals","(Authority Figure) Exposes Behind the Scenes (Industry) Scandals","+1288","Authority – Because this is coming from a farmer, this story is more believable. Negativity – People love drama and this title promises lots of it. Curiosity – “Behind the Scenes” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret."
"$6M/Year Business at 20… Luck or Secret?","","-85","The best YouTube titles make a bold statement that make you say, “Really? No way!” then you’ve gotta click to find out. This title finishing with “Luck or Secret?” isn’t bold and isn’t tangible enough to make you click. Plus, the title and thumbnail say the same thing — they don’t work together to build even more curiosity. Here are some other ways they could’ve written this title: They could’ve focused on the fact that he knew a secret: “He Built A $6M/Year Business After Learning This Secret” They could’ve focused on the constraint of him being so young: “He Sold $9,000,000 Before He Turned 20” Or they could’ve appealed to a deep desire that many people have: “$6M/Year Business at 20 Following His Passion” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"100 Hours to realize you can do THIS in Spider Man 2","(Time Frame) to realize you can do THIS in (Entity)","+459","Curiosity – This opens a loop because it makes you want to know what “THIS” is. And the thumbnail is a picture of something about to happen, which adds more curiosity and tension. Time Frame – This is an example of input bias because this creator putting “100 Hours” into Spider Man 2 to learn this makes us value it more."
"Improve Your Reading and Listening Skills With This Strategy","Improve Your (Activity) Skills With This Strategy","+487","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to improve their reading and listening skills. Curiosity – This title opens a loop because it makes you wonder what “this strategy” is. The thumbnail builds curiosity because it asks a question."
"I Survived The World’s Coldest Town (-97°F, -72°C)","I Survived The World’s (Extreme Entity)","+1025","Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it’s extreme and unique: “The World’s Coldest Town“ Negativity – The harsh conditions pictured in the thumbnail and word “Survived” leverages fear to get the audience to click."
"All religions explained in 10 minutes","All (Complex Topic) explained in 10 minutes","+1743","Time Frame – The time frame of “in 10 minutes” brings two benefits to this title: It makes this video feel more tangible (which makes it more interesting).



It increases your desire to watch it because it’s a complex topic explained in a relatively short time. Curiosity – The contrast between “all religions” (a complex topic) and “explained in 10 minutes” builds curiosity."
"How to REALLY Increase Your IELTS, TOEIC & TOEFL Scores","","-72","I’m not in this niche, but I feel like this might be a pretty narrow topic. But in addition to the potentially narrow topic, this title could be better. The word “REALLY” doesn’t provide any benefit to the audience. Here are a few simple ways they could’ve rewritten this title: “How to Increase Your IELTS, TOEIC & TOEFL Scores As A Beginner” “How to Increase Your IELTS, TOEIC & TOEFL Scores In 1 Hour” “How to Increase Your IELTS, TOEIC & TOEFL Scores Without Spending Hours Practicing” “How to Increase Your IELTS, TOEIC & TOEFL Scores In 2024” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"5 Things I Don’t Do In My Home As A Pro Interior Designer | Julie Khuu","5 Things I Don’t Do In My (Possession) As A (Professional)","+405","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This leverages a bit of fear because the audience wants to know if they’re doing something wrong. Authority – This title brings credibility because she says she’s a “Pro Interior Designer” and she’s talking about what she doesn’t do in her own home."
"I spent a year searching for the weirdest music tech","I spent a year searching for the weirdest (Thing)","+601","Time Frame – Input Bias is a psychology term that means we value something more when somebody puts a lot of time into something, so the time frame of “a year” makes you feel like this video is going to be more valuable than just “I searched for the weirdest music tech.” Curiosity – Using words like “weird”, and making them extreme (the weirdest) are two ways to build curiosity."
"5 Signs He’s Emotionally COMMITTED To You","5 Signs (Deep Desire)","+1158","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to know that their guy is emotionally committed to them. This is a great example of using words that your audience uses and describing their goals and desires in a way that makes them feel understood. “Signs” – The word “Signs” is a word that often does well on YouTube."
"I Learned Blender in a Week","I Learned (Complex, Desirable Thing) in (Short Time Frame)","+8722","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn blender. Time Frame – The time frame of “in a Week” makes this video more tangible, impressive, and interesting."
"How To Thrift Like A Boss for Artwork and Home Decor | Julie Khuu","","-74","I love experimenting and trying new things, but this seems like it was one of the cases where the experiment didn’t pan out. Most of the videos on her channel seem to be educational lists where the video has very clear value and structure. This thumbnail text tells you this video is a vlog, which may not fit what the audience is expecting and looking for from this creator. And to make things worse, the title and thumbnail are both busy and complex, which makes it hard to process when you’re quickly skimming through YouTube. The easiest way to make the title clearer and simpler is to focus on one thing. She could’ve taken out the “artwork” and just written: “How To Thrift Like A Boss for Home Decor”. I probably also would’ve taken out “like a boss” because it doesn’t really provide any value to the audience and their interests and instead, I would’ve doubled down on the thrifting part. Maybe something like this: “How To Thrift For Beautiful Home Decor Under $20” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Do you REALLY need Full Frame? (APS -C Vs Full Frame Vs Medium Format)","Do you REALLY need [Item]? ([Option A] Vs [Option B] Vs [Option C])","+355","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by asking a common question. The “Vs” at the end also build curiosity because you want to see how they compare."
"The NEW LOOK Golden State Warriors Are A PROBLEM","The NEW LOOK (Entity) (Exciting Description)","+619","Timeliness – People love news and new things. The Warriors got some new players this offseason and this video was published the day after their first preseason game, so it was everybody’s first chance to see the “NEW LOOK Golden State Warriors”. Negativity – The word “PROBLEM” is dramatic in a good way. Desire – Even though this title says the Warriors are a “PROBLEM”, it means they’re awesome, and since this channel is a channel about the Warriors, the audience loves it."
"Just Bury Bananas in the Garden and This Happens","Just (Simple Action) and This Happens","+705","Curiosity – The title and thumbnail both open a loop because they make you want to what will happen. The thumbnail is amazing because it’s a mid-action shot and it’s a shot of somebdoy doing something a little odd."
"Why you Must NOT Shoot Medics in War","Why you Must NOT (Seemingly Obvious Activity You Would Do)","+707","Curiosity – This is counterintuitive because you would assume you can shoot anybody in war. A simple way to build curiosity is to tell people what not to do, instead of telling them what to do."
"Do THIS around your toilet (GENIUS new flooring hack!)","","-97","The thumbnail earlier in this newsletter from this same channel about pouring Dollar Store gems into ice water shows something simple. And this title is about a new flooring “hack”… But getting on your hands and knees and painting your entire bathroom floor does not feel like a simple hack. Plus, the thumbnail of pouring Dollar Store gems into ice water shows something just about to happen, while this thumbnail kinda uses the same strategy, it’s not as clear and simple, so it’s not as effective. So the biggest lesson from this video is if you’re showing a hack, make it simple and easy. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"A 16-Year-Old Guitar Store Owner Sold Me An INCREDIBLE Guitar","A (Unexpected Person) (Action) Me An INCREDIBLE (Entity)","+364","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: 1) A “16-Year-Old Guitar Store Owner” is unexpected because that’s so young to be a store owner. 2) It opens a loop because you want to know what the guitar is. (The thumbnail adds to this by showing only the back of the guitar). Desire – This creator’s audience loves incredible guitars."
"Huge Lies New Home Builders Are Telling You!","Huge Lies (Authority Figures) Are Telling You!","+474","Negativity – “Huge Lies” leverages fear and grabs the audience’s attention. Curiosity – This title opens a loop because you want to know what lies you’re being told. Authority – New Home Builders have a lot of power in the home-buying process and the real estate market, so if they’re lying to you it’s a big deal."
"I Made Huberman’s Morning Routine Work For An Average Person (myself)","I Made [Authority Figure]’s [Recommendation or Routine] Work For An Average Person (myself)","+10920","Authority – Dropping Huberman’s name grabs the attention of people wanting to try his routine (AKA the whole internet right now because he’s blowing up). Desire – This creator’s audience is interested in or wants to try Huberman’s morning routine. Refute Objection – A lot of people think, “I’d love to try Huberman’s morning routine, but it’s too hard.” But this creator saying she made it work for “An Average Person (myself)” gets rid of that excuse."
"Someone Called the GAME WARDEN Because I Was Catching Giant Fish!","Someone Called the (Authorities) Because I Was (Awesome Activity)!","+57894","Authority – Calling the game warden increases the magnitude of what’s going on here. Negativity – This title promises a lot of drama, which people love. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to catch such big fish that somebody calls the game warden on them. Curiosity – “Giant Fish” and the thumbnail only showing a splash and an arrow build curiosity because they make you wonder what type of fish was caught."
"The 5 Chords Every Guitar Player Should Know","","-85","This is a decent title and a proven topic, so why did it flop? First, this video is more education-focused, whereas videos that have done well on this channel, like “A 16-Year-Old Guitar Store Owner Sold Me An INCREDIBLE Guitar” are more entertainment-focused. This doesn’t fit the audience’s expectations, which makes it harder for the video to succeed. Second, the title and thumbnail could be better — they’re a little plain. A few title options could be: The 5 Chords Every Beginner Guitar Player Should Know



The Only 5 Chords Beginner Guitar Players Need To Know



The 5 Chords Every Guitar Player Should Know In 2024



Learn The 5 Chords Every Guitar Player Should Know (In 8 Minutes) A few thumbnail options could be: Swapping out the number 5 in the current thumbnail for text saying “Simple”, “Easy”, or “Takes 10 Minutes”



Someone playing a common or popular chord with an arrow and text saying “Stop This”



A two-panel thumbnail showing the wrong and right chords, with a red X and a green check All this being said, this is an example of how good ideas don’t always pan out, but keep going because you can figure it out and grow your channel by learning from what works and what doesn’t.

"BOYFRIEND DOES MY VOICEOVER (Makeup Tutorial)","[Person] Does [Unexpected or Opposite Thing] ([Activity] Tutorial)","+391","Curiosity – The contrast of boyfriend and makeup tutorial voiceover builds curiosity and adds humor here."
"American tries GREGGS for the first time","(Person) tries (Foreign Thing) for the first time","+405","Curiosity – Just like the previous video, the contrast of “American” and “Greggs” (A popular British spot) builds curiosity and humor."
"The Hunt for the King of the Dark Web","The Hunt for the King of the (Negative Entity)","+648","Negativity – People love drama and this title promises a lot of it, plus “King of the Dark Web” is a pretty scary name. Epic – “The King of the Dark Web” feels epic and makes this video much more interesting. Curiosity – The picture of the guy with his eyes blacked out and his name make you wonder who he is and what he did."
"The Mirror Principle | If You Don’t Change This, Reality Will Never Change","The (Named Principle) | If You Don’t Change This, (Entity) Will Never Change","+3188","Curiosity – This opens a loop because it doesn’t tell you what “This” is, so you have to click to find out. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to change reality. Negativity – This is a bit of a warning, which grabs the audience’s attention and makes them want to click."
"My Current Favorite Lipsticks","","-85","This probably flopped for two reasons: 1) It doesn’t really fit with the rest of the videos on the channel. The others are funny challenges or awkward situations, then there’s this list of lipsticks. 2) The title is pretty boring. She could’ve spiced it up by: Using the current year



Positioning this video as ranking the best and worst lipsticks



Or even titling it as her favorite lipstick in the world, and maybe in the video talking about several different ones for different situations Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"when living below your means seems *IMPOSSIBLE* (how to get by) | MONEY SAVING TIPS","When [Best Practice] seems *IMPOSSIBLE* (how to [Achieve Goal])","+696","Negativity – This title is all about a deep, specific problem the audience is experiencing. Calling it out grabs the audience’s attention and gets them interested in this video."
"How I see the US after living in Europe for 2 Years","How I see (Entity) after (Activity) for (Time Frame)","+716","Curiosity – This title opens a loop because it makes you want to see the difference between the US and Europe. Time Frame & Credibility – The time frame of “living in Europe for 2 Years” adds credibility because it’s not just a tourist’s opinion — he’s actually lived in Europe for a couple of years."
"Once you visualize correctly, the shift happens IMMEDIATELY. (this is how.)","Once you [Activity] correctly, [End Goal] happens IMMEDIATELY. (this is how.)","+825","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by using two open loops: 1) It doesn’t tell you how to achieve this shift, so you have to click and watch. 2) It also promises that you’ll achieve an amazing, but open-ended goal, so your mind starts to wander and imagine your own “shift”. (Using specific goals in titles also works very well, but this builds so much wonder, curiosity, and desire that the vagueness works well here. The buzzwords “visualize” and “the shift” also help.) Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn how to visualize and shift their lives, and they would love to do it immediately (people love speed)."
"The FIRST Sign of a Magnesium Deficiency Is… (Dr. Berg Explains)","The FIRST Sign of [Problem] Is… ([Authority Figure] Explains)","+1453","Negativity – This leverages fear because the audience doesn’t want to be magnesium deficient. Curiosity – This opens a loop because it doesn’t tell you what the first sign is. Authority – Using this creator’s name (Dr. Berg) builds authority and trust becauses he’s a doctor. Urgency – There’s ugrency here because if you can spot the first sign, then you’re in much better shape than if you have a dozen signs and it’s too late."
"The DOPAMINE Myth","","-80","The title and thumbnail text are too vague and too similar. There’s nothing tangible that makes you say, “Oh wait, really? I’ve gotta learn more!” One option they could do is to use the thumbnail text, “The Dopamine Myth,” and then have the title be something like, “Dopamine Doesn’t Make You Happy”. Then the thumbnail would support the title, but be different, and might work better because it’s more tangible and challenges your assumptions. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Can I 100% Every Mario Kart Game in 1 Week?","Can I (Achieve Goal) in 1 Week?","+691","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question. Time Frame – The time frame of “in 1 Week” makes this video more tangible and adds a constraint. Both of these make this video more interesting. “Every” – I’m surprised by how often I’ve seen the word “every” pop up in successful videos. I’m assuming it makes the video feel more epic because it adds scale. This isn’t just about a few Mario Kart games, it’s about every Mario Kart game. This same exact format actually got this creator another 2.4 million views a few months ago. The title was, “Can I 100% Every 3D Mario Game in 1 Week?” This is a good reminder to continue doing what works."
"How A Silent Album Robbed Spotify Of $20,000","How A (Counterintuitive Entity) (Negative Action)","+1269","Curiosity – A “Silent Album” is an oxymoron. This contrast and counterintuitiveness builds curiosity. Negativity – Robbing Spotify of $20,000 is full of drama and people love drama."
"A sewing trick how to sew a zipper correctly without waves","A (Activity) trick how to (Achieve Goal) without (Problem)","+3416","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to sew a zipper correctly without waves. Negativity – Calling out the problem (and showing it clearly in the thumbnail) does a great job at grabbing the audience’s interest."
"The one regret from high school that I still think about all these years later","The one regret from (Time Period) that I still think about all these years later","+4141","Negativity – The word “Regret” is so powerful and emotional and does a great job at bringing people into your video. Curiosity – This opens a loop because you want to know what the regret is. Relatable – This is such a strong emotional thing that everybody can relate to."
"10 Minute Phrasal Verb Test: Can you pass?","","-74","I’ve been speaking English for 32 years and I have no idea what a phrasal verb is. If your audience doesn’t know what something is, they’re probably not going to click. This also might be a small potential audience issue. The first video in this newsletter about “200 Important English Expressions” is applicable to pretty much everybody learning to speak English, but how many people are looking to take a phrasal verb test? To avoid this mistake, use simple words in your titles and talk about topics with a large potential audience. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"9 Legendary Hacks Pro Designers Use in Adobe Illustrator","9 Legendary Hacks Pro (Profession) Use in (Tool)","+812","Desire – This creator’s audience wants hacks for Adobe Illustrator. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Authority – This title has more credibility (and makes you want to watch it more) because it’s about hacks that Pro Designers use."
"Why So Few Americans Live In This HUGE Area Of The West Coast","Why (Counterintuitive Fact)","+1410","Curiosity – The contrast between “So Few Americans” and “HUGE Area” builds curiosity. Negativity – “‘Empty’ West Coast” in the thumbnail and “So Few” in the title hint at something dramatic or scary. Clarity – This title and thumbnail are simple and clear (more on this in the Flop of the Week below)."
"10 STOIC LESSONS TO HANDLE DISRESEPECT (MUST WATCH) | STOICISM","10 [Niche] LESSONS TO HANDLE [Problem] (MUST WATCH) | [Niche]","+1665","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This is all about handling a problem: disrespect."
"7 Clues to SPOT the Narcissist EARLY!","7 Clues to SPOT the (Problem or Unwanted Person) EARLY!","+2145","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – “Narcissist” grabs the audience’s attention and makes them want to click because they don’t want to deal with narcissists. Desire – Most people can spot narcissists, but this creator’s audience wants to spot them early."
"Why China Is Building Artificial Islands To Control The South China Sea","","-94","The title and thumbnail from this channel featured above are so simple. One glance and you instantly know what the video is about. This title and thumbnail are much more complex. This makes it harder to tell if you’d be interested in this video, so you scroll on by. Plus, this channel’s audience seems to be most interested in American geography. The double whammy of a non-American subject with a complex title and thumbnail landed this video in this week’s flop of the week. To avoid this mistake, make your titles and thumbnails clear and make videos about things you know your audience is interested in. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Facebook is WORSE than You Think: Whistleblower Reveals All | Frances Haugen x Rich Roll","(Entity) is WORSE than You Think: (Person) Reveals All","+441","Curiosity – This packaging builds curiosity two ways: 1) The title opens a loop and makes you wonder, “How is it worse than I think?” 2) “Reveals All” in the title and “The Truth About Facebook” in the thumbnail make you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Negativity – There’s lots of drama and fear in this title, which grabs people’s attention and makes them want to click. Confirms Suspicions – There’s already a narrative that Facebook is evil, so when some people see this title they say, “I knew it!”. People love when their suspicions are confirmed. Broadly Appealing – I don’t think Frances Haugen’s name is that well-known (no offense, Frances), so giving her the label “Whistleblower” is an effective strategy. It attracts a broader audience because it’s more easily understood. Obviously they did drop her name at the end, but using her name at the end and the label before it was a good call. “Facebook is WORSE than You Think: Whistleblower Reveals All” is so much more powerful than saying “Facebook is WORSE than You Think: Frances Haugen Reveals All”, right?"
"The Ultimate 5 Minute DRIBBLING WORKOUT  NBA Ball Handling","The Ultimate 5 Minute (Activity) WORKOUT (Emoji) (Keywords)","+720","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to get better at dribbling. Time Frame – By saying this is the ultimate “5 Minute” dribbling workout, this makes this drill seem more achievable and attractive because it’s so short, and makes this video more interesting because you know exactly what it’ll be about. Authority – The thumbnail has an image of Kyrie Irving, the best ball handler in NBA history."
"WEIRD Non-Hobby Tools That’ll Change Your Hobby","WEIRD Non-(Activity) Tools That’ll Change Your (Activity)","+817","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: 1) The word “Weird” is a simple way to build curiosity. 2) “Non-Hobby Tools That’ll Change Your Hobby” is counterintuitive. Desire – This creator’s audience loves tools and “Change Your Hobby” hints at improving it. The thumbnail also tells you these are “great” tools."
"I watched 151 celebrity house tours and they’re full of lies","I (Activity) (Amount) (Entity) and they’re full of lies","+2429","Credibility – The fact that she watched 151 house tours makes you feel like her opinion is more valid than somebody who’s watched one. This is also because of “input bias,” meaning that we value when somebody put a lot of time into something. Negativity – “They’re full of lies” promises this video will have lots of drama, which people love."
"Has Big Tech Doomed Democracy? | Baratunde Thurston X Rich Roll Podcast","","-88","The video featured earlier in this newsletter about Facebook worked because people wanted it to be true. I’m wondering if this video flopped partly because the audience are fans of big tech and don’t want this to be true. Also, it’s not very specific. “Big Tech” in the title and “Media” in the thumbnail don’t evoke as much emotion as “Facebook”. Finally, when I first read the title I saw “Baratunde Thurston” and said to myself “What the heck is this word? It’s too long, I’m gonna skip this title.” I didn’t realize it was the guy’s name, I just saw a big word and mentally checked out. (Sorry Baratunde!) Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"21 Old Fashioned Frugal Living Tips to Try Today (that will save you thousands )","21 [Descriptive] [Niche] Tips to Try Today (that will [Benefit] [Relevant Emoji])","+366","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This title combines several things this creator’s audience is into: old-fashioned things, frugal living tips, saving thousands."
"One building, two sketching techniques| Ink & watercolor tutorial","One (Entity), two (Techniques) | (Niche) tutorial","+517","Desire – This creator’s audience is into different sketching techniques. Curiosity – This builds curiosity because you want to see how the two different sketching techniques compare to each other."
"I got a few inexpensive, but super handy new sewing tools","I got a few inexpensive, but super handy new (Niche) tools","+1202","Desire – Not only does this creator’s audience like sewing tools, but they (and nearly every other audience) likes inexpensive, super handy tools. Curiosity – There’s some contrast between “inexpensive” and “super handy” which builds curiosity and makes this video more interesting."
"You’re (Probably) Killing Your Fruit Trees","You’re (Probably) Killing Your [Possession]","+3551","Negativity – Telling people they’re probably killing something they’re trying to grow does a great job at grabbing their attention and getting them to click. And the thumbnail shows something that many people think is good, but has the warning sign over it and text telling them not to do it."
"The Windsor Chair…The ULTIMATE Woodworking Challenge","","-95","The title says this video is about the windsor chair, but what does the thumbnail say? You can barely see the chair because it’s tiny, dark, and off to the side. Instead, her face takes up most of the frame. If I were to redo this thumbnail, I’d show the chair big and bright and close, and show why it’s the ultimate woodworking challenge. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"What I Wish I Knew BEFORE Moving to Charleston, SC from Ohio","What I Wish I Knew BEFORE (Action)","+379","Curiosity – This title opens a loop and makes you wonder what he wishes he knew. Negativity – There’s a hint of regret or warning in this title. If you’re considering moving to Charleston, this grabs your attention."
"10 Expensive Looking Color Combinations | Fashion Over 40","10 (Desirable Entities)","+403","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This is a proven topic for fashion channels — this creator’s audience wants to look expensive (without spending the money to be expensive). But broadly speaking, getting a benefit for cheap is a trend that’s proven across nearly every industry."
"The TRUTH about shooting at ISO 100 that the PROS know.","The TRUTH about (Activity) that the PROS know.","+698","Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: 1) It opens a loop and makes you wonder what the truth is. 2) It makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret and finally learning the truth. Authority – This leverages the authority of the pros to get people more interested in this video."
"11 Of The Most Faked Foods In The World | Big Business | Insider Business","11 Of The Most Faked (Items) In The World","+1224","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Faked Foods – This brings a bit of drama and curiosity (two of the most powerful click triggers). Epic – “In The World” makes this video feel more epic and fun."
"How to photograph the NORTHERN LIGHTS.","","-76","This video flopped because it has a small potential audience. Unless you’re searching for this, you’re probably not going to watch this video. On the other hand, many photographers use ISO 100, so “The TRUTH about shooting at ISO 100 that the PROS know”, featured earlier in this email, can be watched and enjoyed by many photographers. If you want to make videos that get lots of views, you need to have a relatively large potential audience. In addition to this problem, this title is boring. Here are two options for how he could’ve spiced it up: Beginner’s Guide To Photographing the NORTHERN LIGHTS.



How to photograph the NORTHERN LIGHTS In 2023. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"I Created an Anonymous Rapper to “Prove its not Luck”","I Created an Anonymous (Entity) to “Prove its not Luck”","+372","Curiosity – This title builds so much curiosity because it starts a story and makes you want to know what happened. Credibility – Creating an “anonymous” rapper makes you feel like this will be a legitimate challenge that leads to a (hopefully) replicable result. Refute Objection – A lot of people who want to be music artists probably think it’s luck that other people have made it, so this title tackles that objection head on."
"I Tried Zone 2 Training for 3 Months. This Happened","I Tried (Trend) for 3 Months. This Happened","+509","Curiosity – This title opens a loop and makes you want to know what happened. Timeliness – Zone 2 Training is trending right now, so this video rides that wave. Time Frame – Trying something for a specific time frame makes the video more interesting because it’s more tangible and you know exactly what this video is about. The time frame also helps with this next point. Credibility – Since he actually did zone 2 training for 3 months it makes this video more believable."
"10 Free AI Animation Tools: Bring Images to Life","10 Free (Trend) Tools: (Action)","+514","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – Not only is this creator’s interested in AI tools, but everybody loves free tools."
"Struggles of African Immigrant Working in Canada","Struggles of (Specific Situation)","+39833","This video was a massive breakout from a new channel and I’m not *exactly* sure why it did so well, but I have a few theories: Negativity – People love negativity and drama. Talking about struggles and how a country isn’t worth it definitely fits that. Confirmation – A lot of people in the comments are essentially saying “Yes, I know! This has been my experience too.” When you confirm what lots of people are thinking, but may not be openly talked about, they’ll want to watch and comment. Specific Audience – When you go too specific on YouTube it’s easy to have too small of a potential audience. But people living in Canada, Africans, and immigrants seem to rally around this video saying this is what they’re feeling. If you (and the YouTube algorithm) can find a specific audience that has strong feelings about your content, you can win big."
"7 Generative Fill Techniques You Need To Try","","-96","I don’t think there was one major reason this video flopped, but a combination of several reasons: This video is for Photoshop users. Photoshop is a paid tool, while Midjourney, ChatGPT, and many other AI tools he mentions in his channel are free to use. It’s possible his audience is more into free tools than paid tools.



The title is a little bland. He could spice it up by saying this video is for beginners, it’ll help people make images fast, they don’t have to have any graphic design experience, etc.



The thumbnail is kinda boring. It’s just the Photoshop beta logo, no really cool showing of what it can do. (Yes, it technically shows what generative fill can do, but in a boring and nonobvious way.) Plus, his face is not in the thumbnail. This is important because when you look at his channel, this thumbnail doesn’t really look like it fits the rest of his channel, and he appears to have a pretty strong brand (so putting his face in the thumbnail would probably help).

"The HIDDEN MESSAGE in this Season 4 Scene from the Chosen?","The HIDDEN MESSAGE in (Entity)?","+1176","Curiosity – Talking about “hidden” things is a great way to build curiosity. Timeliness – This video was published soon after the creator of The Chosen released teaser footage previewing season 4."
"I created a BARBIE dreamhouse in Animal Crossing!","I created a (Trending Thing) in (Niche)!","+1956","Timeliness – This video was published the day after the Barbie movie was released, so everybody was talking about it. This is an excellent example of trendjacking and applying a seemingly unrelated trend to your niche."
"This One-Page Productivity Hack Will Change Your Life","This (Limited) (Activity or Goal) Hack Will Change Your Life","+2081","Desire – This creator’s audience wants productivity hacks that will change their life. Constraint – The constraint of “one-page” enhances the desire because it seems simple. It also adds curiosity because it makes you wonder how a small thing like a “one-page” productivity hack can change your life."
"Stop Wasting Your Money on These 7 USELESS Supplements! | Dr. Steven Gundry","Stop Wasting Your (Resources) on These 7 USELESS (Tools)","+2820","Negativity – Telling your audience to stop doing something they’re currently doing or think is good for them is a great way to get their attention. This also leverages loss aversion because nobody wants to waste money on useless things. Curiosity – This title makes you want to click to learn what these 7 supplements are. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"BIGGEST Lies on Food Labels: 3 Ways You’re Being TRICKED With Misleading Food Labels | Dr. Gundry","","-94","The title and thumbnail are both too complicated. There’s so much going on that you don’t know what to focus on. You scroll on by because it’s too much work to try to understand what the video is about. If I were to rewrite this title, I’d probably use “3 BIGGEST Lies on Food Labels” *or* “3 Ways You’re Being TRICKED With Misleading Food Labels” (not both, like this title did).

"The Wrong Way to Cross the Border into Canada (NEW BRUNSWICK)","The Wrong Way To (Nerve-Wracking Activity)","+472","Negativity – This video is about something potentially nerve-wracking, and to make matters worse, they apparently did it the wrong way. Curiosity – This title opens a loop and makes you wonder what happened."
"I Worked at REI for 12 Years – Here’s the REI Gear You Should Buy!","I Worked at (Place) for (Time Frame) – Here’s the (Products) You Should Buy!","+554","Credibility – Sharing that she worked at REI for 12 years makes you trust her more when it comes to REI gear. Time Frame – If she just said she worked at REI, that would add some credibility, but the time frame of 12 years adds even more. Desire – This creator’s audience loves buying gear."
"This Is WORSE Than the 1929 and 2008 Yield Curve Inversions","This Is WORSE Than the (Previous Worst Events)","+570","Normally titles with big words like “yield curve inversions” land in the flop of the week section, but this one works for a few reasons: 1) The thumbnail does a great job of showing exactly what this video is about. 2) This title makes sense even if you take out the complicated words at the end: “This Is WORSE Than the 1929 and 2008” Now here’s what actually got people to click: Negativity – This creator’s audience knows how bad 1929 and 2008 were, so that fear grabs their attention and gets them to click. Timeliness – This video is about what’s happening right now, so it grabs people’s attention."
"I Bought Bootleg Nintendo Games from Temu","I Bought Bootleg (Objects) from (Controversial Store)","+740","Curiosity – “Bootleg” items build curiosity because you never what you’re gonna get. Negativity – Temu has a shady reputation which adds controversy and another element of uncertainty to this video, and “bootleg” adds to the controversy, too."
"When Frank Ocean and Tyler The Creator Unite","","-86","There’s no emotion or intrigue here, it’s just a plain statement. They could’ve gone with: A positive angle: “The Magic of Frank Ocean and Tyler The Creator”



A negative angle: “The Downfall of Frank Ocean and Tyler The Creator”

"What’s WRONG with the Twitter 𝕏 Logo","What’s WRONG with (Trending Thing)","+484","Timeliness – This video was published right around the time Elon changed the name from Twitter to X and changed the logo, so everybody was talking about this. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by asking a question and the thumbnail builds curiosity with the red circle making you wonder what’s wrong with it. Negativity – People are drawn to negativity and drama and critiquing a new logo of a popular company fits this perfectly."
"The truth about organic food – according to science | Tim Spector","The truth about (Topic) – according to (Authority) | (Authority Figure)","+484","Curiosity – “The Truth About” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret and finally learning “the truth”. This phrase also opens a loop because you need to click to learn the truth. Negativity – The title feels a little ominous and the thumbnail supports that feeling with the text admitting “I Was Wrong”. Authority – “according to science” gives this title a little bit more credibility."
"Copper to Champion in ONE STREAM – R6 Ranked Speedrun Attempt","(Beginner) to (Expert) in ONE (Activity or Unit of Time) – (Keywords)","+891","Constraint – The challenge of going from beginner to expert level in just one stream makes for an entertaining video."
"How She Makes $50k a month from Mini-Mailboxes?","How She (Achieves Goal) from (New and Unlikely Opportunity)?","+4702","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to make $50K a month with a business. New Opportunity – New opportunities (like making money with mini-mailboxes) offer hope. People haven’t failed with making money from mini-mailboxes yet, so they’re excited about this new opportunity."
"The truth about menopause supplements | Dr Sarah Berry","","-90","This title uses the same framework as the organic food title above, so why did it flop? Probably because of the smaller market. Many people in this creator’s audience are interested in organic food, but I’m assuming not as many are currently interested in menopause supplements. I’m not saying views are everything when it comes to YouTube videos, but if getting more views is your goal, it’s important to consider the size of the market.

"Rocket Raccoon Sculpture Timelapse – Guardians of the Galaxy","(Trending Entity) (Activity)","+470","This is a simple example of adapting your content to what’s going on now. This video was published the day before Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (a popular movie largely about Rocket Raccoon) was released."
"How to Avoid Burnout In Your Software Job Search","How to Avoid (Pain Point) In Your (Activity)","+684","Negativity – This is all about avoiding a pain point (in this case, burnout)."
"8 Football Tricks That Have Been BANNED From Football","8 (Activity) Tricks That Have Been BANNED From (Entity)","+766","Banned – “Banned” adds curiosity and controversy to this video, which makes it way more interesting than just regular football tricks. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"BET YA DIDN’T KNOW YOUR CRICUT COULD DO THIS","Bet Ya Didn’t Know (Tool) Could Do This","+1003","Curiosity – This title opens a loop because it makes you wonder what your Cricut can do. Desire – This creator’s audience loves using their Cricut."
"Renting Equipment For DIY Home Improvements| 9 Tips Every DIYer Should Know","","-89","I think this video flopped for two reasons: 1) The topic isn’t exactly what his audience watches his channel for. It seems like the videos that do best for him are small DIY house projects anybody can do (like installing an AC unit, the first video in this email), not big projects that require you to rent heavy duty equipment like what the thumbnail shows. 2) The potential audience is small. Many people have window AC units, but much fewer people are willing and able to rent heavy duty equipment for their house projects. To avoid this mistake, know why your audience watches your channel and if your topic has a big enough potential audience. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"What Crops to Sow in June for Self-Sufficiency","What (Entity) to (Activity) in (Specific Time) for (Goal)","+380","Desire – This creator’s audience loves crops and self-sufficiency. Timeliness – This video was published on June 1, when people were thinking about what they could plant in June. Curiosity – This title is a bit of a cliffhanger because it leaves you wanting to know which crops are in the video."
"Making A Music Video From Start to Finish (Behind the Scenes, VFX, Color Grading & MORE)","Making A (Entity) From Start to Finish ([Specific Details])","+517","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn how to make music videos and showing them how to make one from start to finish promises a ton of value. It kinda feels like the new version of “The Ultimate Guide” content that got played out in the early days of content marketing. Beginner – Talking about making videos from start to finish also feels very beginner-friendly, and beginners are the biggest, hungriest part of any audience. Length – I’m not saying this is why this video did so well, but it’s interesting to note that this video is ~3 times longer than most of the other videos on this channel. It probably got a ton of watch time and gave the audience time to build a stronger bond with the creator."
"$ix Figures My First Year As A YouTuber? True Or False? You Decide…","(Goal) My First Year As A (Position)? True Or False? You Decide…","+788","This title breaks all the best practices, but it’s such a good idea that it still did well. Here’s why the idea is so good: Desire – Most YouTubers would love to make six figures in their first year. Beginners – Talking about his “first year” relates to beginners, which is the biggest, hungriest group of any audience. Controversy – Many people think it’s impossible to earn six figures in their first year and this creator presses on that with “True Or False?” This question also builds curiosity. Platform Fit – It’s probably worth mentioning that another reason this did so well is that it’s a YouTube video talking about how much he made on YouTube. If this video was about much he made on TikTok, it might not be so powerful."
"I secretly learned my mother’s language","I secretly (Emotional Activity)","+11143","Emotion – Speaking her mother’s native language with her hits you right in the feels because it’s so personal. Curiosity – Learning her mother’s language “secretly” builds curiosity because people love secret things."
"A Day in the Life of Huw Richards","","-77","People watch this channel to learn something that benefits them. The video featured from this channel earlier in this email titled, “What Crops to Sow in June for Self-Sufficiency,” is a good example of this. But this video is creator-focused. This is a good strategy for people like Logan Paul, Emma Chamberlain, or other entertainment creators, but not as much for educational creators. One thing I would try is to position this video as a day in the life of what the audience’s dream is, like this: “A Day in the Life of a Full-Time Farmer” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"8 Small Changes To Improve Your Life Forever","","+404","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to improve their life forever. Plus, the “small changes” to improve your life “forever” makes it seem like you’re getting a lot for a little. Curiosity – There’s contrast between “small changes” and “forever”. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"I Shouldn’t Be Allowed To Show You This…","","+485","I normally don’t like this vague title style, but the thumbnail gives you enough context that the title doesn’t need to spell out what the video is about again. The curiosity (this title promises to reveal a secret) and negativity (the disgusting car and rebellious vibe of the title) combine for successful packaging."
"Can A Regular Guy Shoot Better Than A Navy SEAL?","","+564","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: 1) There’s contrast between “regular guy” and “Navy SEAL”. 2) It asks a question."
"Guess The Price of These New Construction Homes In Tampa! Which Would You Choose??","","+596","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question and feels kinda like trivia. Desire – This creator’s audience is into new homes in Tampa."
"This Might Be The WORST Idea I’ve Ever Had…","","-82","This title doesn’t give enough context for you to be interested in the video unless you’re a big fan of the creator. If you’re going to use a vague title (like this channel did earlier in this email with the dirty car), the thumbnail needs to make it abundantly clear what your video is about. This video has a vague title and a vague thumbnail, which is a recipe to land in the flop of the week. It’s hard for your audience to be interested in a video where they don’t know what it’s about.

"every MIDI keyboard should have this feature in 2023","","+534","Curiosity – This title opens a loop because it makes you wonder what “this feature” is. Timeliness – Dropping the current year in there lets the audience know this is about new products. Desire – Most audiences love hearing about products and tools."
"The Only 10 Exercises Men Need To Build Muscle | 4X Mr Olympia Chris Bumstead","","+1261","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to build muscle. Specific Audience – Calling out men specifically makes men more likely to watch this video. Curiosity – The constraint of “only 10” makes you wonder what these exercises are and why they’re so special. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Authority – Dropping Chris Bumstead’s achievement of “4X Mr Olympia” adds credibility and authority to make him more believable."
"Housing Market Predictions: The 2023 Housing Crash Has Just Begun (It’s Now Completely Illiquid)","","+1778","Negativity – This title is all about the fear of a housing market crash and the thumbnail adds to that with a warning. Timeliness – Everybody seems to be waiting for a housing crash and putting the current year in there also grabs the audience’s attention. Curiosity – Talking about predictions for the future builds a ton of curiosity."
"20 Thru Hiking Tips in 6 Minutes for Your FIRST Thru Hike","","+2021","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Time Frame – The time frame of 6 minutes make this video with a lot of tips feel less intimidating. Beginner – Making videos for beginners (in this case, for people looking for their FIRST thru hike) is a great strategy because it attracts a large, specific subset of the audience that is also willing to learn. Desire – This creator’s audience loves thru hikes."
"What Does Everyone Misunderstand About Eugenics?","","-85","The best titles are written in simple, easy-to-read language. Is “eugenics” a simple word? No. Also, bold statements often work better than questions. If I were to rewrite this title, I’d turn this into a statement with an opinion, instead of just posing a vague question about an intellectual topic. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The biggest myths about emotions, debunked | Lisa Feldman Barrett","","+493","Curiosity – Debunking myths is a great way to build curiosity."
"BABY GROOT to KING GROOT, explained in 3 minutes!","","+660","Timeliness – This video was published 6 days after Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was released, so everybody was talking about this at the time. Time Frame – The time frame of “3 minutes” makes you feel like you’re going to understand this complex topic in a short amount of time."
"Jordan Peterson’s Thoughts on Andrew Tate","","+995","Authority – This is clash of the Controversial Titans right here. Dropping both of their names makes this video irresistible to this audience. Drama – The expression on both of their faces promises this video will be filled with lots of drama."
"$420 Dinner in Tokyo – Kobe Beef vs. Matsusaka Beef vs. Kuroge Wagyu","","+1678","Desire – This channel’s audience loves expensive dinners and fancy steaks (can you still call them steaks at this level?). Curiosity – This title makes you wonder what the outcome of this competition is and which beef is the best. Authority – Although there are no “authority figures” in this title, Wagyu and Kobe are household names that grab people’s attention. Epic – The expensive price tag, Tokyo, and the famous types of beef all make this video feel epic."
"The First Cut is the Deepest","","-95","This title breaks the #1 rule when it comes to writing titles: Be clear, not clever. This title tells you nothing about what’s in the video, so people don’t click. To avoid making this mistake, be crystal clear about what your video is about in your title.

"How I Manage My Money On A Low Income (Budgeting + Saving)","","+371","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to know how to manage their money. Specific Audience – By saying this is for people on a low income, this makes this video way more attractive to people on a low income (which is a large potential audience). Negativity – This title calls out a pain point (low income) and promises to help manage it better. Accessible – Like the video above about cheap accessories, this video appeals to a big audience because many people are on a low income."
"I Visited the Most Remote Town in the USA (Outside of Alaska)","","+501","Extreme – Doing extreme and epic things like this is more interesting than, say, “I Visited A Really Remote Town”. Negativity – “The Most Remote Town” instills a bit of fear and heebie-jeebies, which also makes this video more interesting."
"How to INSTANTLY Improve Circulation in Your Feet and Toes","","+522","Desire – Not only do many people want to improve the circulation in their feet and toes, but they also want to do it instantly. Curiosity – “Do This” in the thumbnail is a cliffhanger that makes you want to click and find out what “this” is. Negativity – “Bad Circulation?” in the thumbnail calls out a common pain point."
"EMERGENCY EPISODE: Ex-Google Officer Finally Speaks Out On The Dangers Of AI! – Mo Gawdat | E252","","+1013","Negativity – This title hypes up the drama with “EMERGENCY EPISODE” in the beginning and doubles down on it by talking about the dangers of AI. “EMERGENCY EPISODE” also adds urgency to this video to make you want to watch it now. Authority – Since this is from an Ex-Google officer, this title has more credibility. Timeliness – Everybody is talking about AI right now, so this video rides that wave."
"The Surprising & Unbelievable Dark Side Of Open Relationships: Aubrey Marcus | E242","","-80","Good titles make you say, “Wait, what?!” *Clicks video to find out more* This title makes me say, “There’s a dark side to open relationships? Duh!” There’s no curiosity here because it’s obvious there’s a dark side to open relationships. The best titles are non-obvious. They challenge the audience’s assumptions and show them a new truth. To avoid making this mistake, know what your audience believes to be true and in your title and thumbnail show them they’re actually wrong. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Engineering the perfect ONE TILE city in Cities Skylines!","","+681","Constraint – The constraint of “one tile” adds curiosity because you want to know how he did it. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to make (or watch this creator make) a perfect city."
"The Sad Story of the Smartest Man Who Ever Lived","","+1004","Negativity – People love drama and this title promises a lot of it. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways. 1) You would think it’s great to be the “Smartest Man Who Ever Lived”, so the fact that he has a sad story is a bit counterintuitive. 2) The fact that this is about the “Smartest Man Who Ever Lived” adds an element of uniqueness to the story."
"i made the same design in every program ever","","+1178","Curiosity – You want to see what happens in this experiment, so you have to click. Credibility – There’s an element of credibility and believability to this video because it’s not just his opinion on the different design programs, he’s actually making something with them all."
"Why You Struggle to ARTICULATE Your Thoughts Clearly. 5 TRUTHS!","","+2641","Negativity – The pain point of struggling to articulate your thoughts clearly grabs the audience’s attention and makes them want to watch. Curiosity – In addition to this video being about a pain point, this title promises to tell you why you struggle with this pain point, so it makes you want to click and find out why. List – This title finishes off with a list of 5 truths, which makes this video feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and adds some curiosity."
"The Tylenol Murders that Terrified America","","-95","I think this flopped for two reasons. The first is that I don’t know how believable this is. Yes, murders that terrified America make for a great story that could be successful on YouTube… but do you actually believe that there are Tylenol murders? Tylenol feels too innocent. Nobody is here saying “I knew it! Let me check this out so I can tell my friends.” Now if this video was about vaccine deaths that terrified America, then everybody would be saying “I knew it! Let me check this out so I can tell my friends.” Also, this channel is about tech news and business, not medicine, so this is also about the wrong topic for this channel.

"99% of EXs WILL Come Back and CHASE you IF you do this ONE THING | Scientific Studies Included","","+473","Desire – This creator’s audience wants their exs to come back and chase them. Curiosity – This opens a loop because it doesn’t tell you what “this ONE THING” is, but makes you want to know what it is, so you have to click. 99% – The “99%” catches people’s eyes and adds a bit of curiosity."
"Create a Spectacular Quilt with Just Scraps and this Free Pattern!","","+518","Desire – This title promises a lot for a little by saying you can get a spectacular quilt with “just scraps” and a “free pattern”."
"My CREEPIEST Commission Story [Art + Storytime]","","+926","Creepy – People just love creepy stories a lot."
"Want to be Rich? DON’T Start a Side Hustle.","","+1040","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to be rich and the question in the beginning lets the audience know this video is for them. Curiosity – A lot of people want to start side hustles because they want to be rich, so this title telling you not to start a side hustle is counterintuitive to that thought."
"Scottie Scheffler Makes This Challenge Look EASY…It’s NOT!","","-85","There’s no reason for the audience to watch. This channel is more about education than entertainment, so the audience wants to learn something from these videos. But this title is all entertainment and doesn’t promise any benefit to the audience. To avoid this mistake, know why your audience watches and deliver it to them in every video. Also, if it were me, I’d test “World’s Best Golfer” in place of Scottie Scheffler’s name in the title. I’m not really up to date with current golfers, but “World’s Best Golfer” is more broadly appealing than “Scottie Scheffler” (no offense, Scottie), and they already put his name in the thumbnail.

"Mat Armstrong got SCAMMED on his Murcielago project!","","+806","Authority – Mat Armstrong is a popular YouTuber in the car niche and this creator’s audience probably knows and likes him. Dropping his name in the title makes them more likely to click. Negativity – People love drama and “SCAMMED” in the title and “THEY LIED…” in the thumbnail promise a lot of it."
"Most People Don’t Even Realize That This Is In The Bible","","+922","Curiosity – This builds curiosity three ways: 1) It opens a loop because it doesn’t tell you what “this” is. 2) It makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret and learning the truth about what’s in the bible. 3) There’s contrast between the monster in the thumbnail and what people would expect to be in the bible. Negativity – The scary monster does a great job at grabbing attention."
"He Farms 35 Hours a Week By Himself and Makes 6 Figures","","+1053","Desire – Many people in this creator’s audience would love to make 6 figures farming. Constraint – The constraint of only 35 hours a week and farming by himself builds curiosity because it seems impossible. Time Frame – The time frame of “35 hours a week” makes this video more tangible and, therefore, more interesting."
"The Reason I’m Switching to Sony After 14 Years With Canon as a Professional Photographer","","+1061","Curiosity – This builds curiosity two ways: 1) You want to know the reason she’s switching from Canon to Sony. 2) Change like this does a great job of starting a story and building curiosity. Drama – There’s a bit of drama here with switching from one brand to another. Time Frame – The time frame of 14 years shows how much experience with Canon she has, which adds to the drama of switching away from it. It also helps with this next point… Credibility – This creator’s opinion holds more weight because she’s a professional photographer and she’s been using Canon for 14 years."
"Dear Earth….. You Need Hear This","","-86","There’s a fine line between leaving out enough details to build curiosity and leaving out too many details and not getting your audience’s interest. This title doesn’t have enough details. This channel is about the bible, but there are no words in the title or images in the thumbnail to let the audience know that they would like this video. There’s really not much at all in the thumbnail or title that lets you know what this video is about or who it’s for, so relatively few people clicked. To avoid this mistake, make it clear in your title and thumbnail what your video is about and who it’s for. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Eating For $1 A Day (Full Week)","","+493","Curiosity – A challenge like this builds curiosity because you want to know how it worked out. Plus, the constraint of just $1 a day adds to the curiosity. Time Frame – Adding a time frame to a challenge like this makes it more tangible (and therefore more interesting). Relatable – Doing cheap challenges like this are more relatable than, say, “Eating for $1,000 A Day (Full Week)”."
"I Tried Buying The Cheapest House In California","","+693","Curiosity – This builds curiosity because you want to know how it worked out. And taking things to the extreme (“the cheapest house”) adds to the curiosity because it’s unique."
"Underwear SECRETS Every Woman Should LEARN","","+758","Curiosity – Talking about secrets is a great way to build curiosity. Specific Audience – This creator calls out specifically who should watch this video with “Every Woman”, which gets more women to click. Provocative Subject – This probably wouldn’t have performed as well as if it was about t-shirt secrets. (Although now that I think about it, maybe it would’ve done well since it’s relatable and everybody wears t-shirts? I think that would all come down to how good the thumbnail is.)"
"Don’t Move to Seattle,Washington Unless You Can Handle These 6 Things!","","+2157","Negativity – Warnings do a great job at grabbing our attention and getting us to click. Curiosity – “These 6 Things” opens a loop because it doesn’t specify what the 6 things are, so you have to click to find out. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"BEHIND ROCK’S MOST ICONIC GUITAR RIFF: Deep Purple","","-87","This is a similar format to the first video in this email (also from this channel): “STING’S MOST COPIED RIFF – Why it’s so HARD to get it right,” but there are 3 main differences: Negativity often works better than positivity (“most copied” vs. “most iconic” and “why it’s so hard” vs. “behind rock’s most iconic guitar riff”).



There’s not much curiosity here. “Behind rock’s most iconic guitar riff” doesn’t really put any question in your mind, and the thumbnail and title tell you it’s about “Smoke On The Water” by Deep Purple.



I’m not the most knowledgeable when it comes to rock bands, but I know who Sting is and I’ve never heard of Deep Purple. It might’ve been better if they wrote the title as “Behind Rock’s Most Iconic Guitar Riff” and in the thumbnail said something like “This Is Insane” or “This Is Genius!” That would’ve added a little bit more curiosity. They could’ve also added more curiosity or negativity, but I think that simple change would’ve done better with the current packaging idea. And then there’s the fact that this video is half as long as the video about Sting’s most copied riff. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"What Can $1,000 Get in VIETNAM (World’s Cheapest Country)","","+546","Curiosity – This title opens a question in the audience’s mind and gets them wondering what $1,000 will get you in Vietnam. Extreme – This video is so much more interesting because it’s about the “world’s cheapest country,” not just a pretty cheap country."
"This is REAL Ketchup and its Mind Blowing","","+677","Curiosity – This video’s packaging is counterintuitive. The brown stuff is clearly not ketchup, but the thumbnail text and title make you wonder if maybe it actually is ketchup, so you have to click to find out. Later in this email, there’s actually another video that used the exact same strategy."
"He lived (and died) through every Backpacker’s WORST Nightmare…","","+1198","Negativity – This title is full of fear, which does a great job at getting people to click. Curiosity – This title opens a loop and makes you wonder what exactly is a backpacker’s worst nightmare (and what happened to this guy?)."
"The Hammer, Reinvented.","","+4740","Curiosity – The thumbnail is counterintuitive. It definitely doesn’t look like a hammer, but when you read the title, you wonder if maybe this is the hammer of the future. New Opportunity – People love new things and this video is apparently about a new hammer."
"5 FATAL Mistakes that left this hiker Stranded until Death (learn from them)","","-93","Most of the videos that do well on this channel are entertaining stories: “The Most Horrific Crime In National Park History” (329K views)



“The Strangest Death in the History of Backpacking” (492K views)



“He lived (and died) through every Backpacker’s WORST Nightmare…” (3M views) Educational lists, like this one, don’t seem to do as well. This channel isn’t that bad (they only have 2 content formats), but I’ve seen many creators treat their channels like a content dumping ground. (I think I got this term from ​@jamierawsthorne​.) They post podcasts, tutorials, vlogs, and whatever else they create on their channel. If it were me, I’d double down on what’s working by creating just one content format, and stop doing everything else. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"How I Went from 3:59 to 2:48 in the MARATHON","","+588","Desire – Many people in this creator’s audience want to run a marathon in under 3 hours. Progress – Telling people how you went from point A to point B starts a story and builds curiosity. Credibility – This isn’t just an empty “how to” video, it’s about “How I”, which makes this video more believable."
"Train Your Brain To Make More Money Now | Marisa Peer","","+644","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to make more money now. Curiosity – There’s something about “train your brain” that feels like a shortcut that could actually work, but it’s mysterious enough that it builds curiosity and makes you want to click."
"The 5 New Commercial Aircraft That Will Change The Way We Travel","","+1289","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – “Change” builds curiosity because you know something will be different, but you don’t know what, so you have to click and find out. “New” – People love new things. That’s it, that’s the tweet."
"Mix detergent with SALT  You will not believe the incredible result","","+1384","Curiosity – The title builds curiosity by opening a loop and not telling you what will happen. The thumbnail builds curiosity by showing something that’s just about to happen. Both of these make you feel the need to click and see what happens. Broad audience – Everybody has detergent and salt in their home, so nearly anybody can enjoy this video."
"What Was it Like To Fly The SR-71 Blackbird","","-92","Do you know what the SR-71 Blackbird is? Yeah, me neither. And although this creator’s audience loves military planes and many of them might know what the SR-71 Blackbird is, it would be more powerful (and easy to read) if they titled this video something like: “What It Was Like To Fly The Fastest Military Plane In History” Giving things labels and taking them to the extreme is a great way to make obscure topics more exciting and easy to understand. Oh… and when you’re making your thumbnails, make sure the text is easy to read. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"How to Make $10,561 / month with Digital Products Using AI","","+498","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to make over $10K/month, and making it with digital products using AI makes this possibility even more exciting. Timeliness – This title rides the wave of everybody being excited about AI."
"5 Reasons to Retire as Soon as You Can","","+781","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Urgency – This title hints that there’s some urgency to retire, which makes you want to click more. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to retire as soon as they can."
"Apple’s New Glasses Are Genius, Here’s Why","","+1600","Desire – This creator’s audience loves new products. Curiosity – The “Here’s Why” opens a loop that makes you want to click and learn why these glasses are genius. Timeliness – This is about a new product and people love new."
"Top 8 Anti-Aging Foods To Eat After 50","","+3481","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This video talks about aging, which is a big problem this target audience is facing. Specific Audience – By calling out people over 50, this attracts a specific (but huge) audience, which makes them more likely to click."
"I got monetized in 12 weeks – HERE’S HOW I DID IT","","-91","This title is good because it’s about achieving a big goal in a specific time frame, right? Well, maybe if this was a YouTube education channel. But it’s not. She talks about selling on etsy, digital products, and side hustles. Her audience probably doesn’t know or care what “I got monetized” means. This video probably would’ve done better if she spoke in terms her audience understands. Maybe something like, “I Made $X,XXX On YouTube in 12 weeks – HERE’S HOW I DID IT.” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"These Triggers Are “The Tell” That You were Neglected and Ostracized As a Child","","+634","Curiosity – This title opens a loop because it doesn’t specify what “these triggers” are, so you have to click and find out. Negativity – This picks at a very intense pain point for many people, which makes them want to click and learn more about it."
"12 Free Tools I’d Use to Learn Japanese (If I Could Start Over)","","+716","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn Japanese and “free tools” makes it sound even better. Beginner tips – The “If I Could Start Over” part relates to and attracts beginners, which is the biggest, hungriest part of any audience."
"I Made Famous Logos ULTRA Realistic","","+1020","Curiosity – The realistic logo on the right being blurred out and the title both do a great job at starting a story, but leaving you on a cliffhanger so you have to click and see what they look like and how he did it."
"Toyota CEO: “This New Engine Will Destroy The Entire EV Industry!”","","+12857","Negativity – “Destroy the Entire EV Industry” is full of drama, which grabs people’s attention and makes them click. Timeliness – The fact that this is about a new engine makes this feel like news and tells the audience this is relevant right now. Authority – This uses the position of “Toyota CEO” to grab attention and build credibility."
"Tren Maya: Mexico‘s Biggest Megaproject","","-89","I think this flopped because it’s a boring idea. The Tren Maya is just a train cutting through the jungle that nobody wants (according to the video). Compare this to the other video in this edition from this channel mentioned earlier about The Cube. It’s a massive golden cube big enough to fit 20 Empire State Buildings inside of it. Because this is a bleh idea, the thumbnail turned out bleh too. The image in the Tren Maya thumbnail is a little unclear. Then, once you realize it’s just a path cut in the jungle, it’s unimpressive (and kinda sad if you’re a tree hugger like me). To avoid this mistake, make sure you have a great topic, title and thumbnail before you spend time and money creating your video. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"3 WORDS to USE in your next JOB INTERVIEW for GUARANTEED SUCCESS! (JOB INTERVIEW TIPS!)","","+361","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants tangible tips (3 words to use) and guaranteed success for their interview."
"4 Old Jeans Ideas | DIY Denim Bags and Purse | Compilation | Bag Tutorial | Upcycle Craft","","+436","This channel is interesting because she does several videos about individual DIY denim projects, then does a longer compilation video with 4-9 of the projects and that video always does really well."
"I Tried A REVERSE Coloring Book?? *It SOLD OUT??*","","+541","Curiosity – This is about a proven topic (coloring books), but there’s a twist because it’s a *reverse* coloring book. The fact that it sold out adds curiosity and drama."
"7 FATAL Wiring Mistakes Most DIYers Don’t Know They Are Making | Most Are Guilty of 3","","+918","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Not only is this about mistakes, but “FATAL” increase the stakes and adds more fear to this. Curiosity – “Most DIYers Don’t Know They Are Making” makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret."
"TRAVEL AGENT Interview Questions & ANSWERS! (How to PASS a Travel Agent or CONSULTANT Interview!)","","-89","This title flopped in the short term because it caters to such a narrow audience. Anybody can get value from the title mentioned earlier in this email (“3 WORDS to USE in your next JOB INTERVIEW for GUARANTEED SUCCESS!”), but this video is only for travel agents. It’ll probably rank well in search and get views over these next few years, but there is this question: Is it worth it to make such niche videos that will get a few views each month when you could instead focus on broader-appeal videos that may get more views overall? Many creators have to ask themselves that question and it’ll be different based on each keyword and your monetization strategy. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"MLB’s Most Overrated Player: The Rise and Fall of Javier Báez…","","+436","Extreme – People on YouTube love extremes. In this case, the “most overrated player” worked well (not just “a really overrated player”). Negativity – People love to hear drama-filled stories like this one."
"How To Grow Jalapeño Peppers (For Beginners) From Seed To Harvest – Pepper Geek","","+594","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to grow jalapeno peppers. Beginners – Making this video specifically for beginners attracts the biggest, hungriest subset of the audience."
"The REAL Reason Why Jewish People Reject Jesus As The Messiah","","+924","Curiosity – This title makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Negativity – This is the car crash effect in action. People are drawn to drama."
"The $300 Street Photography Camera No One Knows About","","+2445","Curiosity – This title makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Desire – This creator’s audience loves cameras, especially relatively cheap ones."
"Pregnancy Checklist: How to Plan for Birth","","-84","This channel is all about productivity, finance, and self-improvement. This video about pregnancy doesn’t really fit with what the audience watches this channel for. Plus, pregnancy is pretty niche compared to the above topics, too. So to avoid this mistake, know why your audience watches your channel and deliver on that. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Dark Side of Minimalism: “Decluttering Ruined My Life”","","+386","Negativity – People love drama and this title is full of it. Timeliness – Minimalism and decluttering are popular trends right now. Curiosity – Most people think minimalism and decluttering is great, but this title is counterintuitive and claims that it’s bad."
"Haircare Mistakes That Will RUIN Your Hair","","+824","Negativity – Nobody wants to make mistakes or ruin their hair, and this title uses that to get people to click. The thumbnail also adds to the negativity with a warning."
"12 Reasons People REGRET Moving To North Carolina","","+1125","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Nobody wants to have regrets, and this title uses that to its advantage."
"This SIMPLE TRICK Changed Everything for me","","+2211","Desire – People love “simple tricks”, and “Changed Everything” is open-ended (which builds curiosity), but sounds like something cool happened. Curiosity – This title is a cliffhanger because it doesn’t specify what the trick is. Specific Audience – The thumbnail calls out people over 40, which makes them more likely to click."
"HOW MUCH MONEY DID WE SAVE? | No-Spend Challenge | minimalism + frugal living","","-84","I think this flopped for two reasons: 1) It’s too complicated. It’s not easy to instantly read and understand, so people scroll on by. 2) This may have been a bad topic for her channel. It seems like her audience is into minimalism and frugalism. Although they’re kinda the same thing as saving money, they have a slightly different vibe. To avoid these mistakes, have simple, clear titles, and know your audience and why they watch your channel.

"I ordered HelloFresh to see if it was a scam.","","+446","Curiosity – This title hints that HelloFresh might be a scam, but it’s a cliffhanger that makes you wonder what the final verdict is. Negativity – Talking about products being a scam does a great job at grabbing the audience’s attention."
"How Stoics Deal With Loneliness","","+738","Authority – This creator’s audience wants to be like the Stoics. Negativity – This is all about a problem people deal with."
"The Sharpest Object In The World Can’t Cut Anything","","+992","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: 1) It’s about something extreme and unique: the sharpest object in the world. 2) It’s counterintuitive. You would assume the sharpest object in the world can cut anything."
"Polestar 3 first look: Possibly the best looking new EV for 2023","","+1011","Timeliness – “First Look” and “new EV” lets the audience know this is about something new coming in the future. Desire – This creator’s audience likes new cars. Curiosity – By saying this is the “best looking” it builds curiosity because it’s unique. And that curiosity is enhanced by only showing a part of the car in the thumbnail."
"The Fraught History of Re-Usable Rocketry","","-79","I like to think I’m a pretty smart guy, but when I read this title, I had to read it twice. Fraught means… not good, right? And re-usable rocketry… that’s what Elon is doing, right? Titles need to be understood instantly because people are mindlessly scrolling YouTube. I think it might’ve been better written as: “The Dark History of Re-Usable Rockets.” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The BEST R6 Attacker NOBODY Plays…","","+478","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways. 1) There’s contrast between “Best R6 Attacker” and “NOBODY Plays”. 2) The title doesn’t specify who that attacker is, so you have to click to find out. Desire – This creator’s audience is interested in good R6 attackers."
"Do collagen supplements really work?  Dermatologist @DrDrayzday","","+487","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to know if collagen supplements really work. Authority – This title drops the creator’s profession in at the end to get people to trust her content."
"TSA Line Mistakes in 2023 (travel tips for airport security)","","+592","Negativity – Nobody wants to make mistakes, and this title benefits from that. This video is also about one of the most frustrating things about flying: the TSA line. Timeliness – Dropping “2023” in there lets the audience know this is relevant right now. Desire – This title finishes off by telling the audience they’ll get the main thing they watch this channel for: travel tips."
"Meet a 23-year old from India running a $20,000,000 company in the US","","+2439","Curiosity – There’s contrast between “23-year-old” and “running a $20,000,000 company”, as well as the fact that this guy is from India, but running a big company in the US. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to run a $20,000,000 company. Plus, everybody likes a good underdog story because they can relate and be encouraged that they can do the same. Authority & credibility – This 23-year-old isn’t just running a small company — $20,000,000 adds authority and credibility that proves he’s legit and you can learn something from him."
"5 INVESTING HABITS That Will Make You A Millionaire (DO THIS IN 2023) | Jaspreet Singh","","-80","This title has it all: a list, a big desire, the current year, and it’s about habits (one of my favorite topics). So why did this flop? Well, the title is a little longer than many of the other recent titles, so that could be it. But honestly, I think this is just a good example that even if you write a great title, your videos won’t always go viral. Make the best title and thumbnail you can, and make the best video you can, then let YouTube do its thing. If you get 1% better with each video and don’t give up, you can make it on YouTube.

"8 Tools I Regret Not Buying Sooner","","+486","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Instead of saying “8 Tools I Love”, this creator said, “8 Tools I Regret Not Buying Sooner”. Everybody wants to avoid regrets and this creator uses that to their advantage here. Desire – Almost every niche loves videos about tools."
"10 Things You Should Avoid Revealing In A Job Interview – Interview Tips","","+497","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This title is a warning against revealing the wrong things in an interview."
"3 Sewing Projects to MAKE and SELL To make in under 10 minutes","","+790","Desire – This creator’s audience loves sewing projects and selling their projects. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Time Frame – The short time frame of 10 minutes increases the desire to make these projects because it makes them seem easier and more achievable. *Note: It looks like they used poor wording with “to make” in there twice, but this is such a powerful framework that’s worked for this channel multiple times that apparently it doesn’t really matter."
"Slowest & Fastest Star WR 40-Yard Dash Times!","","+883","Curiosity – The contrast between “slowest & fastest” grabs your attention. Timeliness – This video was published right before the NFL combine started. Desire – NFL fans are much more interested in 40-Yard Dash times than the other combine events, like the broad jump, for example. Authority – They mentioned “Star WR,” not just “WR,” to grab the audience’s attention. Retention note: The times get progressively faster so you want to keep watching to see the fastest times, and they started with some popular players at first to grab your attention."
"Complete Hewn flooring installation guide","","-93","This video has a small potential audience compared to the rest of the videos on this channel. Unless you’re specifically looking to install Hewn flooring (whatever that is), you probably don’t care about this video. Contrast that to videos that almost everybody can watch and enjoy, like: 8 Tools I Regret Not Buying Sooner

"Toyota Bet EVERYTHING To Destroy German Luxury","","+469","Negativity – This title is full of drama. Epic – Betting “everything” increases the stakes and makes this video more interesting."
"I wish every Christian could watch this.","","+623","Curiosity – This is a cliffhanger that makes you wonder what this video is about. Specific Audience – By calling out Christians, this creator makes Christians — his ideal audience — more likely to watch this video."
"Make Your Yard ANT FREE FOREVER In 3 Easy Steps","","+1434","Desire – This creator’s audience wants an ant-free yard. Negativity – This title is all about a pain point: ants in your yard. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"$599 M2 Mac Mini vs $13,000 Mac Pro | DaVinci Resolve Battle","","+1769","Curiosity – The contrast between the relatively inexpensive $599 M2 Mac Mini and the expensive $13,000 Mac Pro builds curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience loves DaVinci Resolve and Mac products. X vs. Y – Everybody loves a little competition, especially when it’s a competition between two opposite opponents. In this case, a cheap vs. expensive option."
"The Cringiest Fast & Furious Movies RANKED | IDEALIST","","-85","This channel is about cars — only cars. Not movies about cars. A mistake many creators make is making videos about topics their audience isn’t interested in. Or, at least, isn’t interested in hearing about from them. It could be a big difference, like if a fitness channel giving financial advice, or a small difference, like this example. The key to avoiding this mistake is knowing why your audience watches your channel and delivering that. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"5 Reasons why you should NOT move to Chicago","","+767","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – This video is counterintuitive because it’s a Chicago real estate agent telling you why you should not move to Chicago. Negativity – Telling people why they should NOT move to Chicago will often grab their attention more than if you tell them that they should move to Chicago."
"The Single FASTEST Way To Improve As A Producer","","+972","Desire – Not only does this creator’s audience want to improve as a producer, they want to improve fast. Curiosity – This title says there is a single fastest way to improve as a producer, but doesn’t specify what it is, so you need to click to find out."
"6 Outdated Trends to Ditch in 2023 & What to Wear Instead","","+1102","Timeliness – This video was published in the beginning of 2023, so this tells the audience this video is about current trends. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Nobody wants to wear outdated clothes."
"6 Dirty Secrets Backpackers Refuse To Talk About","","+1142","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – “Secrets” that people “Refuse To Talk About” builds a ton of curiosity here because you feel like you’re getting scandalous insider information. Negativity – The fact that these are “dirty” secrets makes this title so much more exciting."
"We Finally Know How To Eat Cactus Without Getting Poked","","-92","Ah yes, the cactus-eating video I’ve been waiting for! I’m not exactly a foodie, so maybe there’s some delicious cactus trend I’m unaware of, but I don’t think this video has a large potential audience. To avoid this mistake yourself, research your video’s topic and make sure your audience will be interested in it before you make the video. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Best Workout Routine for Beginners","","+488","Desire – This creator’s audience wants the best workout routine. Beginner – Videos for beginners do well because they’re the biggest, hungriest part of any audience."
"Quit your 9-5 with these 3 Etsy Store Ideas – Six Figure Strategies","","+548","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to quit their 9-5. Negativity – This title is all about moving away from pain — “Quit your 9-5″. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – This title mentions “these 3 Etsy Store Ideas”, but doesn’t specify what they are, which builds curiosity by opening a loop."
"I’ve Never LOVED An iPhone Case More","","+572","Desire – This creator’s audience love tech accessories. Curiosity – This title is a cliff-hanger — why does he love this one so much? Extreme – This title is a big, bold statement, which typically does better on YouTube than weaker statements (“I Really LOVED This iPhone Case,” for example)."
"HABITS to Break the NEGATIVE Programming of Your MIND! | Joe Dispenza | Top 10 Rules","","+1282","Negativity – This title is about moving away from pain — “Break the Negative Programming of Your Mind.” Plus, there’s a bit of “stick it to the man” vibes, fear, and conspiracy here with the “Programming of Your Mind” part. List – This title finishes off with a list, which builds curiosity and makes this video more tangible."
"$60 DIGITAL NOMAD hotel in Kuala Lumpur","","-86","A $60 hotel is pretty unremarkable. Even if a $60 hotel is the “best hotel in KL” (like the thumbnail says) or expensive for KL, $60 is too average to grab most people’s attention. If it was a $5 hotel or $1,000 hotel, those prices would probably do a better job at getting the audience’s attention. Plus, these creators broke the “Show, Don’t Tell” rule in the thumbnail. They’re telling me in the thumbnail that it’s the best hotel in KL, but they certainly aren’t showing me (what am I even looking at?). Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"NEW Ak-47 in Rainbow Six Siege","","+501","Timeliness & Desire – People love new things. That’s it, that’s the tweet."
"23 INSANELY CHEAP Destinations for Budget Travel in 2023","","+759","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience loves travel destinations. But not only that, they also love cheap travel destinations. Talking about inexpensive things caters to the broadest audience (not everybody can afford expensive things) in a way that people want them (inexpensive). Timeliness – This video was published at the end of 2022, when everybody was thinking about travel plans for 2023."
"Belly Fat, Insulin Resistance, and a Hack to Beat Them Both","","+1154","Negativity – This title grabs the audience’s attention by mentioning two pain points in the beginning. Desire – This title promises to fix both of those pain points with a single hack."
"11 Section layouts to make your website ultra UNIQUE","","+1220","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience loves section layouts to make their website unique."
"Enjoy the Holidays AND Stay Keto","","-91","The most obvious reason this flopped is because it’s boring. The best titles have curiosity, fear, and/or desire, but this title has none of that. But there’s another mistake here: repeating the thumbnail in the title. Thumbnail text should be complementary to the title and work like a 1-2 punch. When you repeat your title in the thumbnail, you’re missing an opportunity to get the audience to click. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"How to Be Less Emotionally Reactive: Black and White Thinking","","+385","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to be less emotionally reactive. Negativity – This is about moving away from pain (being less emotionally reactive), rather than towards pleasure (e.g. being more emotionally stable)."
"MID HANDICAP Golfer BREAKS 80 12 days AFTER USING THIS DRILL!","","+525","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to break 80. Time Frame – “12 Days” makes this drill seem even more effective since it works so fast. Specific Audience – If you’re a mid handicap golfer (which the majority of people are), you feel like this video was made for you. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: 1) It opens a loop with “this drill”. You know this drill is effective, but you don’t know what it is, so you’ve gotta click to find out. 2) It’s counterintuitive that a mid handicap golfer (aka an average golfer) can break 80 (a great score)."
"CUT HER OFF If She Does These Things During The Dating Stage! (VET HER OUT)","","+622","Negativity – This is all about a negative thing, which grabs the audience’s attention. Curiosity – This opens a loop because she talks about the things that mean you should cut her off, but doesn’t tell you what those things are."
"Genius YouTube Advice for 15 Minutes Straight…","","+785","Desire – This channel’s audience wants genius YouTube advice. Time Frame – “15 Minutes Straight” lets you know exactly what you’re gonna get if you click this video, which makes more people click. Authority – The thumbnail uses authority because it has many of the top YouTubers faces’ on it."
"How Genetic Is Mental Illness Actually? Heritability Estimates for Mental Health The Role Genes Play","","-88","This title is too wordy and confusing. There are lots of big words that make it hard to read. I think it could’ve been better if she just took everything out after the question mark. To avoid this mistake, make your titles easy to read while skimming. You don’t need to summarize the entire video in your title. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Should you consider a 1031 Exchange?","","-93","Titles that mention benefits, hopes, and fears typically do better than titles that get into nerdy specifics, like this one. Plus, this video is only 1:42. It seems like either shorts or longer videos work best on YouTube right now… not videos stuck in the middle like this one.

"Things You Only Notice In Starship Troopers As An Adult","","+1254","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by making you wonder what these things are. It also kinda makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. “Adult” – Adult things catch the audience’s attention more because they’re controversial, and people love controversy."
"Pecron 1500 Pro Review – Affordable Off Grid Power Option","","-70","This title is boring. I’m not saying it’s not effective — it probably attracted buyers for the Pecron 1500 Pro and they probably got lots of affiliate sales. Plus, it’ll probably rank it search and do well in the long term. Buuutttt… they could’ve spiced it up a bit. They could’ve turned it into a story or an experiment to get more views and maybe make more sales. For example, he could’ve talked about how long he survived off the grid using only that power station in a video titled, “I Survived 10 Days Off The Grid With No Power.” (Btw I have no idea how long these things actually last.)

"TESS Telescope Found New Planets Better than Earth!","","+395","Timeliness – This title feels like news and people love news. Curiosity – It’s counterintuitive that there are any planets better than Earth, so that build curiosity."

Desire – This creator’s audience wants to lose fat."
"How to Record Multiple USB Mics at Once","","-95","It’s tough to say this video “flopped” because it’s probably meant to rank in search, and therefore is not expected to get many views right away. That being said, I have a few thoughts on this. First, always keep in mind the potential audience size when you’re making a video and make sure it’s worth it for you. In this case, would it make more sense for this creator to spend his time making another video about 10Xing your skills with ChatGPT (see his video above) than a video about recording with multiple mics? Maybe. Second, this title could be spiced up a bit. He could refute an objection (“How to Record Multiple USB Mics at Once without ___”), call out beginners (“How to Record Multiple USB Mics at Once for Beginners”) or used the current year to let the audience know its about what’s working right now (“How to Record Multiple USB Mics at Once in 2023″).

"3 Essential Arpeggios  (Beginner Piano Lesson)","","+455","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

"The Entire NBA FEARS The WARRIORS Because of this PLAY!","","+1191","Negativity – People love hearing about things we fear. Curiosity – “this PLAY” opens a loop because it doesn’t specify what the play is, so you need to watch the video to find out."

"Quit (Quietly)","","-92","I’m a little confused about what’s going on here. Is he telling me to quit quietly? Did he quit quietly? Why should I quit quietly? When it comes to titles, clarity is king, and this title broke that commandment. To avoid this mistake, make sure your audience knows what you’re trying to tell them and why in your title.

"Women are easily attracted to men who know these things","","+580","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity because it doesn’t specify what “these things” are, but gets you interested in them, so you have to click and find out. Desire – This creator’s audience (men) want to easily attract women."
"4 HABITS THAT KEEP GODLY MEN WEAK","","+661","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – This is about habits men should avoid that keep them weak."
"How To Create 30 Instagram Reels in 24 Hours with Canva","","+1589","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to create lots of Instagram Reels fast. Time Frame – “in 24 Hours” makes this video feel more tangible and exciting — it’s about creating a lot of reels in a short amount of time."
"Mustang GT Dark Horse 2024 is Going to be The Game Changer","","+7876","Curiosity – This builds curiosity because it’s talking about a future product, and the future is inherently unknown. Desire – This creator’s audience loves mustangs and new cars. Timeliness – This video was published soon after Ford unveiled their plans for the Mustang GT Dark Horse and everybody was talking about it."
"If you’re a Jealous Person, watch this","","-81","I think this flopped because nobody gets excited and says, “Hey, I’m a jealous person! This video is for me.” I have a feeling that it would’ve done better if, instead of labeling the person as jealous, it positioned jealousy as a problem that can be fixed. Something like, “Watch This To STOP Feeling Jealous.” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"these things helped me escape the matrix","","+356","Curiosity – “These things” builds curiosity because she mentions them, but doesn’t specify what they are, so you need to click to find out. Negativity – This video is all about escaping a scary place."
"I Ate 100 TBSP Of BUTTER In 10 Days: Here Is What Happened To My BLOOD","","+402","Time Frame – “In 10 Days” makes this video feel more tangible. Curiosity – “Here Is What Happened To My Blood” builds curiosity because it’s a cliff-hanger. You want to click and see what happened. Negativity – This title is about doing something many people think is unhealthy, it’s not about how he ate an apple a day for 10 days. Credibility – This video feels very legit because he’s measuring blood, not just sharing how he feels."
"Do These 12 Things as Soon as You Get Into Your Cruise Cabin","","+685","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – “Do These 12 Things” opens a loop because it doesn’t specify what the things are, so you need to click and find out."
"11 Hacks to Make Your Cakes Look Professional","","+1120","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience want their cakes to look professional and they want hacks to do it."
"Dangers of Dry Fasting & Dehydration","","-88","This topic just seems obvious (and therefore boring) to me. Of course there are dangers associated with dehydration! If this was about the dangers of Keto or intermittent fasting, which many people are passionate about and assume is good for you, then I bet it would do better. That being said, there could be some health trend that I don’t know about where people think dehydration is good for you. Anyway, this week’s lesson is this: obvious topics don’t normally work well. Be contrarian, challenge your audience’s assumptions, talk about their fears and desires. Just don’t be obvious. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The GENIUS Reason Why F1 Steering Looks BROKEN","","+426","Curiosity – There’s contrast between “genius reason” and “looks broken”, which builds curiosity and interest."
"6 SECRET SEWING TOOLS YOU DID’NT KNOW YOU NEEDED!","","+440","Curiosity – This title makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience loves learning about sewing tools."
"10 BIG NFL Names Whose Teammates Are SICK Of Them","","+453","Negativity – There’s lots of drama in this title, and people love drama. Authority – “Big NFL Names” grabs your attention more than just “NFL Names”. (Plus it builds curiosity by leaving it open-ended, so you want to know who these players are.) List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"I Tested EVERY Colored Pencil in the WORLD!","","+492","Desire – This creator’s audience is into colored pencils. Credibility – This title makes you feel like this video is legit, so you’re more likely to watch it. Epic – Testing every colored pencil “in the WORLD!” makes this video feel epic."
"10 Times Fans Were Caught Crying Over Their Team in the Stands","","-71","This title and thumbnail don’t fit with the rest on this channel and they don’t call out this channel’s core audience. Every other video on this channel is about the NFL, and these creators make it obvious they’re about the NFL. They have “NFL” in the title and NFL players in the thumbnails. But not this one. So the next time you make a video, make sure it’s about a topic your audience wants to watch on your channel, and make it obvious in the title and thumbnail that your video is about that topic.

"VOLUMIZING HAIR PRODUCTS FOR FINE THIN and THINNING HAIR *before and after*","","+444","Pain Point – This title calls out “thin and thinning hair”, and if you’re struggling with that, you’re pretty likely to click. Desire – This creator’s audience is into volumizing hair products."
"Riding Japan’s $120 Completely Private First Class Bus | Tokyo – Osaka","","+515","Desire – This creator’s audience is into private first-class travel. Plus, “$120” in the title makes it feel more tangible."
"Lifesteal Finally Unbanned This…","","+731","Timely – “Finally Unbanned” makes this video feel like breaking news, and people love breaking news. Curiosity – This title opens a loop by saying Lifesteal unbanned “this”, but not specifying what “this” is. Negativity – The word “unbanned” feels controversial."
"How I’d Start a YouTube Channel in 2023","","+1068","Timeliness – Starting a YouTube channel in 2023 is on many people’s minds right now, so this title rides that wave. Beginners – This is about “starting” a channel, not scaling a channel. It caters to beginners, which are the biggest, hungriest subset of any audience. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to start a YouTube channel in 2023."
"Dental School Q&A | Entering My 4th Year!","","-90","This title probably flopped for two reasons: its boring and off-topic. It’s boring because there’s no emotion. She could’ve added emotion by talking about the hardest or worst thing about dental school. And it’s off-topic because most of her videos are about clothes, not dental school. So the next time you make a video, make sure its about a topic your audience is interested in watching on your channel and include emotion into the title.

"How to Build Muscle At Any Age (7 TIPS!)","","+655","Desire – This creator’s audience wants to build muscle, especially as they get older. Refute Objection – This is all about refuting the objection of, “I’m too old to build muscle.” List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"The Creepiest Historic Hauntings In The British Isles | Historic Hauntings | Absolute History","","+903","Timely – This was published the day before Halloween when everybody was thinking about scary and creepy things. Curiosity – Taking things to the extreme (“The Creepiest” ) builds curiosity because it’s unique. Negativity – This is all about fear and scary things, which grab your attention."
"Shark Released Their Hair Styler… OMG!","","+910","Curiosity – “…OMG!” opens a loop because it’s vague, but makes you want to know what she thought about the hair styler. Timeliness – This feels like news (people love news) because it’s about a newly-released product."
"Forget the Oven, This is How I Make a Prime Rib Now","","+3200","Negativity – This title is about moving away from the old way of doing things. Curiosity – “This is How I Make a Prime Rib Now” builds curiosity by opening a loop. It’s a cliff-hanger and makes you wonder how he makes prime rib now. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to make prime rib that looks like the one in the thumbnail."
"How To Stay Healthy While Traveling (7 TIPS)","","-80","I know this is a topic that’s commonly talked about in fitness, but I don’t think it’s that big of a pain point. How much do you really care about eating healthy while you’re traveling? I think building muscle when you’re older (see the video from this creator mentioned earlier) is a much bigger pain point. Plus, the thumbnail doesn’t really look like it’s about fitness. It’s a girl in a bikini with the words “Travel Tips”. Looks like a travel video to me, so this creator’s core audience might just gloss over it. And finally, since this title flopped, I might try to write it from a negative angle. Something like: “Don’t Do This If You Want To Stay Healthy When Traveling” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"My Airbnb Lost Money… Here’s The Truth About Being an Airbnb Host","","+472","Negativity – People love seeing negativity, plus this is a fear many people in real estate have. Curiosity – This builds curiosity three ways: 1) It opens a loop with “The Truth About”. 2) “The Truth About” also makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. 3) Many people think real estate is a great business model that you can easily make money in, so this is counterintuitive to what they think."
"The World’s Quickest Cars: Lucid Air Sapphire v Bugatti Chiron v Tesla Plaid – Cammisa’s Drag Race","","+533","Curiosity – Taking things to the extreme (“world’s quickest cars”) builds curiosity because it’s unique. X vs. Y – People love competition and want to see how things compare against each other."
"Japanese Minimalist: 6 Habits that help me stay minimal","","+583","Habits – People love habits because they’re tangible and we can envision easily plugging them into our day. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience wants to stay minimal."

Desire – This creator’s audience is looking for work from home jobs. Refute Objection – Someone might see this and think, “I can’t get a job without a college degree.” But “(Without College)” at the end gets rid of that excuse."
"How This Junkyard Chevy Del Ray Is Now Worth $75k | The Appraiser","","-90","It seems like they tried to use contrast to build curiosity: “Junkyard Chevy Del Ray” vs. “Worth $75K”. But I think that failed because it’s not abundantly clear. The thumbnail doesn’t look like a junkyard car and many people don’t know what a Chevy Del Ray is. If I were to rewrite it, I would say, “How This Junkyard Car Is Now Worth $75,000”. Contrast this with the title mentioned earlier about the world’s quickest car. In just four words the idea is conveyed. You know exactly what it’s about and (if you’re a car fan) you’re excited about it. So make your titles and thumbnails crystal clear and use simple words.

"5 Things You Should NEVER Tell Coworkers","","+820","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – What you should never tell your coworkers makes for a more spicy and interesting video than one about what’s ok to tell your coworkers."
"This Food is WORSE than Sugar on a Keto (Low Carb) Diet","","+881","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity three ways: 1) It opens a loop by telling you this food is worse than sugar, but not telling you what it is. 2) It makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret because you assume sugar is the worst thing for you on a keto diet. 3) It’s also counterintuitive because of this. Negativity – Talking about foods that are bad for you gets your audience’s attention more than talking about foods that are good for you."
"These Home Cameras are NOT Private!","","+1004","Negativity – This title picks at a very strong fear in our culture right now."
"Asking Strangers Their Thoughts On Christianity","","+1012","Curiosity – This style of video is going crazy on YouTube right now because it makes you want to know what these strangers said. Credibility – There’s an element of credibility to this style of video because it’s not the creator’s opinion — it’s what real people think or have experienced."
"Answering Your Career Questions","","-90","This title is too boring. I think it could’ve done better if the creator made it a little spicier. Something like: “Answering Your Embarrassing Career Questions”



“Answering Your Toughest Career Questions” On top of the title being boring, the quotes in the thumbnail are boring, too. “Managing workload” is pretty boring compared to something like, “Horrible Boss”. And “what’s up with the hat?” is kinda funny, but doesn’t make me want to click as much as, say, “2023 interview tips”. Even if she didn’t get interesting questions like this, I’d probably throw them in there because it’ll make for a better video and more clickable thumbnail and title.

"The Dumbbell Only 1 Person Could Lift","","+435","Curiosity – This title sounds a little too crazy… a dumbbell only 1 person could lift? But it’s also just believable enough that you have to click to see what’s going on. Plus, it’s open ended. Who’s the 1 person? How much does the dumbbell weigh? These questions make you want to click even more. Constraint – “Only 1 Person Could Lift” adds a constraint, which makes for a much more interesting story."
"10 Amazing DIY Christmas Gifts People ACTUALLY Want! (2022)","","+436","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Timeliness – Lots of people are thinking about Christmas right now and this title rides that wave. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to give Christmas gifts that people actually want."
"WHY THEY ARE PICKING FIGHTS WITH YOU!","","+622","Negativity – This title and thumbnail are all about addressing a big pain point the audience has."
"4 Social Security Changes That Will Have a BIG IMPACT in 2023","","+1665","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two different ways: it talks about change and the future. Both are unknown and open-ended, so you have to click to learn more. Timeliness – Since it’s near the end of the year, people are looking forward to 2023."
"Are Two Narcissists actually “in love?”","","-77","Who’s this video about? Narcissists. Who’s probably not watching videos about love because they think they’re the greatest? Narcissists. This is different from the video mentioned earlier titled, “WHY THEY ARE PICKING FIGHTS WITH YOU!” That video is about narcissists’ victims, who are hurting and probably watching more YouTube than the narcissists. So before you make your next video, think about who’s actually watching your videos. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Towing with my Ford Lightning EV Pickup was a TOTAL DISASTER!","","+367","Negativity – People love drama and this title about a total disaster promises the video will have lots of drama. Timeliness – Ford Lightning EV Pickups are new and everybody is interested in what they can do."
"Harvard negotiator explains how to argue | Dan Shapiro","","+553","Authority – This channel borrows the credibility from this Harvard negotiator to get people to click."
"14 BANNED GADGETS YOU STILL CAN BUY ON AMAZON","","+592","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Negativity – “Banned” gadgets make this video so much cooler than just regular gadgets. Curiosity – It’s counterintuitive that can still buy these “banned” gadgets, which builds curiosity and makes you want to click."
"I saw my boss do these 10 things in Excel!","","+2682","Authority – “My Boss” adds a little extra credibility here. Curiosity – This title opens a loop (and builds curiosity) by telling you about “these 10 things in Excel” but not telling you what they are. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity."
"HERE’S HOW PROFESSIONALS DEEP CLEAN THINGS","","-91","This channel is all about crazy gadgets and inventions (like the banned gadgets video above). You know what it’s not about? How professionals deep clean things. Not that that’s a bad topic, it’s just a bad topic for this channel. So if you don’t want your video to flop, make sure that you’re choosing a topic your audience wants to watch on your channel. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Secret Weapon That Got Me $17,000 in VA Disability Benefits","","+1200","Curiosity – “The Secret Weapon” builds curiosity by making you wonder what it is. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to get $17,000 in VA disability benefits."
"You’re Probably Taking your Vitamin D Wrong, and it Could be Dangerous (& Ineffective)","","+1352","Negativity – This title gets the audience’s attention by giving them a warning."
"5 MYTHS about Bicycle Traveling / Bikepacking vs. Reality // Tips & Tricks // Cycling the World","","+1555","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity. Curiosity – “Myths” add a lot of curiosity because they’re things you think are true but aren’t, so you want to know what the truth is. *Note: I think this title is too long and if I was using this framework, I’d only model the first part."
"4 ONE-MINUTE Habits That Save Me 20+ Hours a Week | Time Management For Busy People","","+14160","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible and they add some curiosity. Time Frame – Time frames also make videos feel more tangible and “one-minute habits” is a great example of this. Desire – This creator’s audience loves to save time. Specific Audience – This title calls out a specific audience with “Time Management For Busy People”."
"How do you prove a service connection for sinusitis?","","-85","A lot of people say that you should make videos about the questions you get from your audience. This feels like that’s what happened here, and this is why I don’t love this advice. In this case, it seems like it’s way too specific of a question to do well on YouTube because it has a small potential audience. So here’s a question I always like to ask myself before coming up with a video idea: is there a big enough potential audience for me to meet my view goals for this video?

"7 RED FLAGS You’re Dealing With An Emotionally BROKEN MAN…","","+329","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible and add a little bit of curiosity. Negativity – Red flags and the fear of dealing with “an emotionally broken man” grabs the audience’s attention."
"4 Things NOT to Say to Your Therapist","","+583","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible and add a little bit of curiosity. Negativity – We’re biologically wired to listen to warnings, and this title leverages that."
"20 Greatest Discontinued Foods of All Time","","+702","Curiosity – There’s contrast between “greatest” and “discontinued” and it’s counterintuitive… why would a great food be discontinued? The contrast and counterintuitive both build curiosity. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible and add a little bit of curiosity."
"Affordable PREFAB HOMES I Had No Idea Existed!","","+1178","Curiosity – “I had no idea existed” is a fun way to build curiosity around a subject because it feels like you and the audience are getting in on a secret together. Desire – This creator’s audience is into affordable prefab homes."
"The WORST Dating Advice For Women You SHOULD NOT Listen To!","","-83","Normally I have a good idea for why a video flopped, but this week I don’t. This video (and my second choice for flop of the week) seems to have a pretty good title. So this is just a reminder that the title isn’t everything. There’s a lot that goes into how successful you are on YouTube. My favorite bit of advice? Get 1% better with every video. Alright, that wraps up this week’s edition of Creator Hooks! If you know a fellow creator who needs help with writing better titles, please send them to creatorhooks.com. Here’s to the war on boring content. – Jake (@jthomas__ on Twitter) P.S.

"You’re Not Lazy: How to Live a Chaotically Organised Life","","+424","Negativity – This title starts out by refuting a self-doubt. Desire – Everyone in this creator’s audience would love to live an organised life. Curiosity – “Chaotically Organised” are opposites, which builds curiosity."
"This “Adult Only” Cruise Was The Worst Cruise I’ve Ever Taken | Virgin Voyages","","+662","Negativity – People love hearing about drama. Extreme – The “Worst Cruise I’ve Ever Taken” makes for a much better story than just a really bad cruise."
"Buddy Valastro Was Never The Same After Cake Boss","","+1086","Curiosity – “Was Never The Same” opens up a loop and makes you wonder what happened to Buddy."
"Stop Standing HERE in Doubles! (why you’re losing)","","+1231","Curiosity – Many tennis players think it’s good to stand at the spot shown in the thumbnail, so it’s counterintuitive for the creator to say stop standing there. Negativity – Telling your audience to stop doing something common is a great way to get their attention."
"5 Things Every Ex-Child Needs to Hear","","-81","I thought this title was funny and clever, but that’s not what get clicks. Clarity beats cleverness every time, and this is a good example of that. So the next time you’re coming up with ideas, ask yourself, is this title crystal clear? Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The ONLY 3 Stretches You Need for Better Flexibility","","+610","Desire – This is all about a big desire for her audience. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible and add a little bit of curiosity."
"The FED Just Gave a Serious Warning To All Americans With DEBT","","+647","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by starting a story, but not finishing it. You can’t help but wonder what warning the Fed gave after reading this title. Negativity – We’re genetically wired to listen to warnings, and this creator uses that to his advantage in this title. Timeliness – The word “Just” makes this title feel like news, and, in general, we’re more interested in news than education. Authority – “The FED” brings credibility to this video. Specific Audience – If you’re an American with debt (which is a ton of people), then you’re way more likely to watch this video because it feels like this was made just for you."
"MIND-BLOWING VINYL HACKS THAT WILL CHANGE THE GAME!","","+670","Curiosity – “Mind-Blowing” hacks is a fun (although maybe extreme) way to build curiosity. Desire – This channel’s audience would love vinyl hacks."
"My Simple Productivity System (for normal people)!","","+675","Desire – This creator’s audience loves simple productivity systems. Specific Audience – By calling out normal people in the title, all us normal people feel like this video was made for us. It also kinda refutes an objection. People might think, “these hacks won’t work for me,” but by ending the title with “(for normal people)”, it gets rid of that excuse."
"What Product Marketers ACTUALLY Do in Tech Companies!","","-89","The video above (the one about normal people) calls out a massive audience with a great benefit. That’s a good formula for a successful video. But this title is about a much smaller audience (product marketers). I would assume that almost everybody wants a simple productivity system, but much fewer people care about what product marketers actually do at tech companies. Here’s a question I always ask when evaluating an idea (BEFORE making the video): “Does this topic have a big enough audience for my view goals?” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Namibia: A Side Of Africa The Media Won’t Show You","","+332","Curiosity – This makes you feel like you’re getting in on a secret. Negativity – This title has an “anti-establishment” or “sticking it to the man” feel to it."
"Top 10 CSS One Liners That Will Blow Your Mind","","+469","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible and add curiosity. Curiosity – There’s contrast between “one liners” (sounds simple) and “will blow your mind” (sounds incredible). Desire – This channel’s audience would love some amazing CSS one liners."
"The Video Credit Card Companies Don’t Want You to See","","+530","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by revealing a secret. Negativity – Like the Namibia example above, this gives a big “anti-establishment” vibe."
"How To Not Look Frumpy & Older Than You Are-Get Out of That Rut!!","","+1750","Negativity – This video is all about avoiding an unwanted outcome."
"How a South African Who Came From Poverty Changed His Life","","-89","The clearest difference between this video (32K views) and the Namibia video above (674K views) is the thumbnail. The Namibia thumbnail is bright and you can clearly see their faces. This thumbnail is dark and the subjects are small. It’s also a little wordy and complicated. To make it simpler and punchier, I would’ve worded it like this: “How a Poor South African Changed His Life”. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"6 Uncomfortable Retirement “Truths” You Need to Hear…","","+466","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible and add some curiosity. Negativity – “Uncomfortable Truths” are way more interesting than, say, “Happy Truths”. Curiosity – This title makes you wonder what these “uncomfortable truths” are, so you have to watch."
"World’s Steepest Climb Vs World’s Best Climber: Can He Defeat It?","","+797","Extreme – Extreme things, like world’s steepest climb and best climber, make for an interesting story. X vs. Y – Everybody loves a little competition and they have to click to see what happened."
"Where Else To Self-Publish Books That’s NOT Amazon KDP – Self-Publish Low Content Books","","+874","Refute an objection – This channel’s audience might think their only option to self-publish books is Amazon KDP, so they’re interested to hear other options. Curiosity – A simple way to build curiosity is to tell your audience about what something is not, so they have to click and find out what it is."
"Food Sticking to Stainless Steel Pans? 4 Common Mistakes to Avoid","","+18966","Negativity – This title starts with a pain point and then talks about mistakes to avoid. List – Lists make videos feel more tangible and add some curiosity."
"Top 5 Ways To Train On Your Commute!","","-78","My first thought was that this flopped because it’s a narrow topic — how many people are actually riding their bike to work? But a video titled, “What’s The Best Way To Ride To Work? | GCN Commuter Challenge,” recently did well for this channel (350K views). My theory is that this flopped because those who are riding their bikes to work are doing it because they enjoy it, not because they’re trying to train hard on their way to work. Whether or not that’s true, the lesson is to always strive to know your audience better and understand their goals and motives. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"24 HOURS IN THE CHEAPEST ALL-INCLUSIVE RESORT IN MEXICO (Playa Del Carmen)","","+393","Time Frame – People love time frames because they make a video feel more tangible — you know exactly what to expect and that makes you more excited to click on it. Extreme – The “Cheapest All-Inclusive” is much cooler than “A Cheap All-Inclusive” Desire – Even though it’s the cheapest one, this video is still about an all-inclusive resort, which is something this audience loves."
"How The YouTube Algorithm Works in 2022","","+555","Timeliness – Since the algorithm is always changing, adding “2022” at the end of the title lets the audience know this is relevant right now. Desire – YouTubers are obsessed with the algorithm."
"7 Dividend Stocks That Pay Me $500+ Per Month","","+752","List – Lists make a video feel more tangible and add some curiosity. Desire – This creator’s audience loves dividend stocks and loves to get paid every month."
"FIX LOWER BACK. BEFORE IT’S IRREVERSIBLE","","+1729","Negativity – This title is all about a pain point and a warning to go along with it."
"Angel Investing, Explained Easy!","","-70","Some topics just have a smaller audience. Here’s a screenshot from Google Trends of Angel Investing vs. Dividend Investing (the topic of a video that crushed it for this channel recently): Knowing that angel investing isn’t exactly the most popular topic, this creator could’ve spice up the title with some curiosity or negativity. Something like: The Best Investment Strategy Nobody Talks About



I Wish I Knew About This Investment Strategy 5 Years Ago Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"The Sudden Rise of UGC","","+422","Timeliness – This is about a current trend and it feels like news. People love news. New opportunity – UGC is a new opportunity for people trying to make money online (this creator’s audience). People love new opportunities because they haven’t failed at the new thing yet, so it offers hope. Negativity – This thumbnail sparks fear in the audience."
"If Only I Knew This About FASTING 5 Years Ago","","+540","Negativity – This is about a regret that this creator has. Curiosity – “If only I knew this…” builds curiosity by opening a loop. What did he wish he knew?!"
"How to Wake up Before 6am Everyday","","+595","Desire – The specific desire of “Wake up Before 6am” is much better than just, “Wake up Early.” Daily – People love things they can plug into their daily routine."
"from BROKE to ABUNDANCE mindset | *how this changed my life*","","+891","Transformation – From a bad state to a positive state promises a good story and is exactly what the audience wants. Curiosity – This builds curiosity a few ways. First, the “how this changed my life” part adds curiosity by opening a loop. Plus “changed my life” adds curiosity because it’s vague and open to interpretation. And finally, there’s contrast between “broke” and “abundance”."
"How MSG Affects the Brain (good, bad, and ugly)","","-82","This probably flopped because it doesn’t take a stance on MSG. Looking at some of his other videos, they’ve either had an opinion (unlike this title’s “good, bad, and ugly”) or built curiosity. The thumbnail is also bland and vague, just like the title. Here are some other angles he could’ve taken with the title: MSG’s Surprising Benefits for Brain Health (positive stance)



STOP Eating These Foods With MSG In Them (negative stance)



This Controversial Ingredient Can Change Your Brain (curiosity driven) Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"My HONEST Opinion After 1 Month in the Philippines","","+541","Time frame – This time frame gives his video credibility because he’s been there an entire month, as opposed to some people who’ve traveled there for just a few days. Curiosity – It might just be me, but the way he uses “HONEST” makes you feel like you’re getting insider information here."
"I SURVIVED 50 HOURS W/ LIVER KING…","","+554","Authority – Liver King’s name and picture makes a ton of people click. Negativity – “Survived” adds to the feeling that you’re about to watch an intense video with some tough adventures. Time Frame – The time frame of 50 hours makes this video feel more tangible and interesting."
"How to LOOK RICH and WEALTHY! Simple tips and tricks to achieve that sophisticated, polished look!","","+602","Desire – This creator really nailed down what their audience wants. “How to LOOK RICH and WEALTHY!” is way more specific than just, “How to Look Pretty.” Plus, people love simple tips and tricks."
"I Quit Teaching & Here’s What I Learned","","+702","Negativity – Quitting something good is a great way to get people’s attention. Curiosity – “Here’s What I Learned” opens a loop and makes you want to find out what she learned. Milestone – Your audience will love hearing about big milestones, like quitting a job."
"Your money is cheating on you (with your bank)","","-87","This title is a classic example of “clarity > cleverness.” It’s not immediately obvious what she means by, “your money is cheating on you.” And if you can’t instantly understand what a video is about, you’ll keep scrolling right past it. This probably would’ve done better with a clearer title, like, “You’re Losing Money Every Day (thanks to your bank)”. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"17 hours in SINGAPORE CHANGI AIRPORT","","+350","Time Frame – People love time frames because they make videos feel more tangible. You can envision exactly how the video will go, which makes you more likely to click. (Note: just because you can envision how the video will go doesn’t mean you can envision what will happen. There’s still curiosity there that makes you want to watch.) These next two click triggers are theories, and I may be stretching it a bit… Curiosity – This video is counterintuitive. Nobody willingly spends 17 hours in an airport — why would you do that? This makes people click. Negativity – There’s fear here: nobody wants to spend 17 hours in an airport. This also makes you click."
"The Car Loan Bubble Just Popped (HUGE Recession Indicator)","","+593","Timeliness – The word “just” makes this video feel like news, and people love news. Negativity – This video is all about scary events: recessions and popping bubbles. Curiosity – Talking about the future builds curiosity, and this title ends by talking about the future."
"6 Reasons Your Photos are not SHARP","","+1055","List – Lists make a video feel more tangible and add some curiosity. Negativity – If you’re a photographer, you definitely don’t want your photos to look “not SHARP.” This creator does a great job at grabbing her audience’s attention by calling out a specific pain point."
"2 Products I Sell Every Christmas To EXPLODE My Etsy Store Sales (Holiday Print on Demand)","","+1345","List – Lists make a video feel more tangible and add some curiosity. Desire – Everyone in this creator’s audience would love to explode their Etsy store sales. Timeliness – Christmas is just around the corner and Etsy store owners are looking to prep for it."
"Can this machine help save the world?","","-80","Here are some of the other videos on this channel: We Tried 7 Simple Exercises to Strengthen our Relationship



How to Eat Less Sugar, Realistically



I Worked Out for 700 Days, Here’s How it Changed Me The audience is here because they want to save themselves, not save the world. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. But as a creator, you need to know why your audience watches your channel and, if you want to avoid having your videos flop, make sure you’re delivering on that.

"3 Feminine Habits Men Find WILDLY Attractive (Make His Heart RACE with Naturally Seductive Behavior)","","+637","Curiosity – There’s contrast between “feminine” and “men” which builds curiosity and makes you do a double take. List – Lists make videos more tangible and add some curiosity. Desire – Women would love to know what these habits are that men find attractive."
"Van Camping in a Heat Wave 111°F","","+1123","Extreme – 111°F increases the stakes in this videos, which makes for a more interesting story. Negativity – People love watching videos about scary things, like camping in a dangerous heatwave."
"I Bought 96 Stocks, Then Did Nothing for 816 Days…","","+1083","Curiosity – This title opens a loop because you want to know what happens after the 816 days. Also, the thumbnail opens a loop, too, by saying, “I Didn’t Expect This…” but not specifying what “this” is. Time Frame – Time frames make videos feel more tangible, which makes them more interesting."
"This NEW Approach to Photography Will Change Your Career FOREVER!","","+2718","New opportunity – People love new opportunities because they offer hope. Curiosity – “Change your career forever” is open-ended, so it opens a loop and builds curiosity."
"We ALL SUCK as BEGINNERS… (The Reality of Becoming a Professional Photographer)","","-94","This title used two of my favorite click triggers: negativity and calling out beginners. So why did it only get 2.8K views, while her video about a new approach to photography got 299K views? Keywords. But not in the way most people think about keywords… “We All Suck As Beginners” is too vague. It needs a keyword to let the audience (not the algorithm) know what her video is about. It could probably be better worded as “Why We All Suck As Beginner Photographers.” To add to this confusion, she’s holding a guitar and a camera in her hand. Which one is this video about? The guitar is obviously much bigger than the camera, so at first glance you might think this video is about sucking as a beginner guitar player, which is not what her channel is about. To avoid this mistake, be crystal clear on what your video is about and who it’s for, and make sure both of those align with your channel’s audience. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Why Germans Don’t Buy Houses | Feli from Germany","","+359","Curiosity – Buying a house is a normal, innocent behavior, so it doesn’t make sense why an entire group of people wouldn’t buy a house."
"3 Bad Habits Every Poor Man Should Give Up","","+531","List – Lists make a video feel more tangible and add some curiosity. Negativity – There’s a little bit of fear here that makes you want to click and find out if you have these bad habits. Specific Audience – By calling out poor men specifically in the title, it makes poor men more likely to click."
"Engineer Builds GREATEST Ambulance Conversion EVER!","","+547","Extreme – Here’s another example of how taking it to the extreme makes for a fun video."
"Best 7 Work From Home Companies Currently Hiring | Remote Jobs Worldwide","","+757","List – Lists make a video feel more tangible and add some curiosity. Urgency – Since this video is about companies currently hiring, there’s a bit of urgency to click now. Desire – This creator’s audience is looking for jobs at remote companies."
"Hilarious Fails & Bloopers from “How German Sounds Compared To Other Languages”","","-92","This video probably flopped for a few reasons. First, this doesn’t really fit with the other videos on this channel. The other videos are all about differences between America and Germany or her experiences as a German in America. Second, you kinda have to have seen “How German Sounds Compared To Other Languages” to really appreciate this. This narrows down the total potential audience. Third, all of the thumbnails have her face on it, and many have the American or German flag. This doesn’t have either of the flags and it kinda has her face on it… but the mustache and wig make her less recognizable. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"6 BIG Purchases Retirees (Almost) Always Regret!","","+770","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible and they add some curiosity. Negativity – Our culture is obsessed with regrets, so that word catches people’s attention and gets them to click. Specific Audience – By calling out retirees specifically in the title, retirees are way more likely to click."
"Raised Garden Beds Are So Yesterday!","","+1012","Negativity – If you currently have a raised garden bed, you probably have a little FOMO because you’re doing something that’s no longer the best. Curiosity – If raised garden beds are so yesterday, what’s the best trend to follow today?"
"Eating The World’s Best Pizza in ITALY","","+1061","Epic – “The world’s best pizza” is so much cooler than “really good pizza”. Desire – The title and thumbnail are simple, but work great together to get you hungry and wanting to see more of this pizza."
"Building My Dream Tiny Home For Under $8000","","+14338","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to build their dream tiny home. Constraint – The fact that he built his dream tiny home for such a small amount of money makes for a great and intriguing story."
"Easy Tips for Conquering Your Fear of Flying","","-89","I think this video flopped for a few reasons. First, this channel is about going on crazy travel adventures across the world. Tips for conquering your fear of flying doesn’t really fit with what her audience is looking for from her channel. Second, how many people who love traveling across the world also have a fear of flying? According to the low amount of views this video got compared to the rest on her channel, it seems like not that many. And third, most of her thumbnails are of beautiful, brightly-colored destinations, not dark plane seats. This video may have served a specific purpose and helped 14,000 people in her audience, which is great. But if you’re looking to maximize views, be sure to pick a topic that a large segment of your audience wants to hear about. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"82hrs on Amtrak’s MOST SCENIC TRAIN! – The California Zephyr","","+909","Extreme – “Most Scenic Train” is much more interesting than “One of Amtrak’s Most Scenic Trains.” Time Frame – The “82hrs” makes this video feel more tangible and gives it credibility because it’s not just a walkthrough tour — they spent a long time on the train."
"Top 10 Poorest Counties in the US. (Poverty=Cheap Real Estate)","","+912","List – Lists make videos feel tangible and add some curiosity. Negativity – People are drawn to negative lists, like this one. When you look at this channel you see some of their highest-viewed videos are negative lists, like “10 Countries People Hate To Visit” and “Nevada’s Worst Rural Towns”. Desire – At the very end they slip in a benefit for real estate folks: “Poverty=Cheap Real Estate”"
"7 Things Plant Experts Do That You Probably Don’t","","+3589","List – Lists make videos feel tangible and add some curiosity. Authority – “Plant Experts” gives this video credibility. Curiosity – This feels like you’re getting some insider information, which builds curiosity. Negativity – “That You Probably Don’t” adds some FOMO to this title."
"Index Fund Investing Could Change Forever","","+3412","Curiosity – “Could Change Forever” builds curiosity two ways. First, it opens a loop and makes you wonder, “What will change? How will it change?” And second, it’s about the future, and people are inherently curious about the future. Negativity – The thumbnail is full of fear — the word, “worried,” and the creator with a worried expression — both of which help to grab your attention."
"Unboxing My New Monitor! | Apple Studio Display First Impressions","","-89","Most of the videos from this channel are about new laptops and phones. New laptops and phones are sexy. Are new monitors sexy? I don’t think so. Plus, almost everybody has a laptop and phone. Not everybody has a monitor. Lesson: if you want your videos to get lots of views, pick a sexy topic that has a big potential audience. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"What a Recession Could Mean For The Commercial Real Estate Market","","+380","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways. First, it opens a loop by not answering what a recession could mean in the title, so you have to click and find out. And second, it’s talking about the future. The future is obviously unknown, so it builds curiosity. Negativity – Negative events, like recessions, get a lot of attention and clicks. Timeliness – Everybody is talking about a recession right now and this creator uses that to his advantage by riding that wave."
"How I Routinely Study With a Full Time Job when I’m TIRED","","+397","Constraint – Studying with the constraint of a full time job makes this video way more interesting. It introduces conflict, and conflict makes for a good story. Plus, many people in this creator’s audience are struggling with trying to study with a full time job, so they relate to this title. Refute objection – “With a full time job” and “when I’m tired” are both objections that people may have when they’re trying to study. When you get rid of people’s excuses in your title, they have no excuse to not watch your video."
"Why Shopping Carts Have Holes + 15 Things You Never Thought About","","+642","Curiosity – This title makes you feel like you’re getting in on a weird secret, and the “things you never thought about” enhances that feeling."
"How a Church Uses Mandalorian Tech | RED KOMODO and Unreal Engine Setup","","+772","Curiosity – The contrast between “church” (which feels non-techie) and “Mandalorian tech” (which feels futuristic) builds a ton of curiosity. Authority – “Mandalorian Tech” is an amazing way to describe tech. And it’s authoritative because, well, we’re talking about The Mandalorian."
"A Productive Day in the Life at Cajun Koi Academy (Kuma","","-89","This title feels too self-promotional. It feels like it’s all about the creator and his academy, rather than about the audience. I’m sure it made lots of money, but it might’ve been better framed as something like, “A Productive Day in the Life of a Study Expert” (his channel is about studying). Framing the video this way makes it feel like he’s aligning with the audience rather than promoting his academy. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Do NOT Shut Down Your Computer! (here’s why)","","+916","Negativity – This title is a warning for you to not shut down your computer. Curiosity – Shutting down your computer feels like an innocent thing to do, so this title builds curiosity because it doesn’t really make sense. It’s counterintuitive."
"German Neighborhoods are ILLEGAL IN AMERICA | Zoning & NIMBY-ism","","+993","Negativity – “Illegal” catches your eye and makes this video more interesting. Curiosity – Like the title above, this builds curiosity because it’s a drama-filled title about a seemingly innocent thing."
"Things I Never Pack Travel 2022","","+1870","Negativity – This is about things she never packs, not things she packs. We’re drawn to warnings like this. Timeliness – Slapping the current year on the end of the title is a great way to tell your audience that this video is relevant right now."
"12 digital products that can make AT LEAST $10k/month","","+2030","Desire – Everybody in this creator’s audience would love to have a product that earns $10K/month. List – Lists build curiosity and make a video feel more tangible."
"My Studio Tour 2022! Where we film & tools we use","","-89","This creator’s audience watches her channel for Excel and technology tips that they can use, not for a tour of the studio where she films. Plus, most of her thumbnails have her face nice and big on the thumbnail, not a zoomed out shot of her on a couch where you can’t really tell if it’s her or not. Both the topic and thumbnail style were new. If you’re going to branch out on one of these, at least use what’s proven for the other. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"How Long Are We Going To Be In A Bear Market?","","+361","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by asking a question. Negativity – This title uses negativity because it’s talking about a negative subject — bear markets. Timeliness – Since we’re currently in a bear market, this title joins the conversation in everyone’s mind."
"10 Simple Exercises To Improve Your Running","","+388","List – Lists add curiosity and make videos feel more tangible. Desire – Every runner wants to improve their running, and they’d also love to do it with simple exercises. Time Frame – The thumbnail includes a short, 10-minute time frame, which makes improving your running feel more achievable."
"5 THINGS ORGANIZED PEOPLE DO (That You Don’t )","","+410","Authority – Organized people have credibility here and this creator’s audience would love to be more like them. List – Lists add curiosity and make videos feel more tangible. Negativity – Finishing this title with “(That You Don’t)” gives you a little fomo. Curiosity – The thumbnail builds curiosity by opening up a loop."
"How to Instantly Make Anyone Respect You","","+727","Desire – Not only is this video about something this audience wants (respect), but it also promises to help them get it instantly."
"How This Pro Runner Handles Race Anxiety","","-75","This title has some good things going for it — authority and a pain point. So why did it flop? I think it’s because the pain point is only shared by a few people. Or maybe most people experience it so few times that by the time they see this video on their home page, they don’t care or have forgotten about it. Contrast this title with something like, “How This Pro Runner Handles Getting Tired While Running.” Everyone experiences this pain point, and they experience it every time they go for a run, so it’d probably get more views. The next time you make a video about a pain point, make sure that there’s enough demand for the video. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Most Underrated Pieces of Backpacking Equipment: Inexpensive Gear That Makes a Difference","","+340","Curiosity – There’s contrast (which adds curiosity) between “inexpensive gear” that “makes a difference.” And “underrated” adds to the curiosity, too. Desire – This creator’s audience loves good gear."
"this is the EASIEST way to find your style (no shopping required!)","","+358","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to find their style and do it the easiest way. Refute an Objection – The audience might be thinking they don’t have time or money to go shopping, but this title gets rid of that excuse."
"3-MUST DO-Daily Strength Exercises For Seniors","","+705","List – Lists build curiosity and make a video feel more tangible. Desire – This creator’s audience is looking for strength exercises to help them stay active. Daily Tips – People seem to really like exercises or habits you can plug into your daily routine.

List – Lists build curiosity and make a video feel more tangible. Time Frame – The time frame in this title refutes an objection. Many websites take a while to pay you, but this promises to tell you about websites that pay within 24 hours. Daily Tips – Another title with a daily benefit here."
"A Simple Day In My Life  How I Build an Outfit, Life Updates, What’s New In My Wardrobe","","-76","This title is all about the creator and has four different subjects, so it’s not as punchy. Plus, it’s about a simple day in her life — there’s no conflict, which is what makes a good story. Contrast this title with some of the others on her channel: “If I was starting my wardrobe from scratch, these are the pieces I’d buy (minimalist wardrobe)”



“What I learned by getting rid of 60% of my clothes ”



“7 things I cut from my budget that I don’t miss at all (where I spend & where I save)” These are more focused, have more emotion, and talk about pain points or desires the audience has.

"START Fishing A KEITECH Like This (Don’t FALL Behind)","","+377","Curiosity – “Like This” opens a loop and makes you wonder how to fish a keitech. Negativity – The “don’t fall behind” part at the end adds a warning."
"Just Permitted 56 Acres to make $50,000/month","","+411","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to make $50,000/month. Timeliness – Starting out with “Just” makes you feel like this video is about a new thing that just happened. It’s kinda mixing news and education together."
"Where does the POWER in the GOLF SWING Come From???","","+469","Curiosity – The title builds curiosity by asking a question. This audience may assume the answer is legs, but the thumbnail adds to the curiosity by showing a guy sitting down and not using his legs. Desire – Most golfers would love to have more power in their swing."
"BROKE AF? Start w/ Zero Make $250 a day online (DO THIS)","","+533","Curiosity – This title starts by asking a question to build curiosity, then finishes by opening a loop to build even more. Negativity – “Broke AF” is a big pain point many people in this creator’s audience have. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to make $250 a day online. Beginner Tips – If you’re a beginner starting from zero, you feel like this video was made for you."
"DON’T Fish Like Everyone Else (Fish The EXTREMES)","","-67","This title was good in that it’s got a warning and kinda opens a loop. But I think it flopped because it doesn’t speak to any real fear or desire. The audience doesn’t fear fishing like everyone else — they fear not catching fish. And they don’t care about fishing the extremes — they want to catch fish. Don’t try to be too clever with your titles and always think about what your audience wants.

"21 Ways You Are Hurting Your Cat Without Realizing","","+566","List – Lists make a video more tangible (you know exactly what the video is about) and build curiosity. Negativity – Nobody wants to accidentally hurt their cat, so they watch this video to avoid doing that. Curiosity – Lists about negative things build lots of curiosity because you ask yourself, “Am I doing any of these?” and you’ve gotta watch to find out."
"WARNING: Bad News For Amazon Sellers","","+944","Negativity – Warnings work really well to get our attention and get us to click. Authority – Jeff Bezos’ shiny bald head is easily recognizable and quickly gets the audience’s attention."
"Asking YOUNG Millionaires How to be Successful","","+1430","Desire – Everyone in this creator’s audience wants to know how to be successful Authority – This creator is asking authority figures (young millionaires) how they did it. Curiosity – You really want to see what these young millionaires say, so you’ve gotta watch this video."
"THIS Simple Trick Makes Your Bathroom & Toilet SMELL AMAZING!","","+1634","Desire – This creator’s audience (and probably — hopefully — most people) would like to have their bathroom and toilet smell good. This title also promises a lot (an amazing-smelling bathroom) for a little (a simple trick). Curiosity – This title opens a loop by telling you there’s a simple trick to make your bathroom and toilet smell amazing, but not what that simple trick is."
"How to Cut and Dice a MANGO!  (real simple and fast life hacks)","","-78","The videos on this channel are mostly about cleaning and house hacks, not so much cooking and kitchen hacks. Cutting and dicing a mango may be a great topic, but it doesn’t seem like it’s a great topic for this channel. So when picking your next video topic, make sure you’re giving your audience what they really want to hear from YOU. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"10 Mixing Tips That Changed My Life","","+445","List – Lists make it easy to understand what the video is about and builds curiosity. Desire – “Changed my life” is a strong desire that many people have."
"HOW TO APPLY FOUNDATION FOR BEGINNERS | NINA UBHI","","+643","Beginner Tips – Beginners are the biggest, hungriest subset of any audience. Desire – A big portion of this creator’s audience wants to learn how to apply foundation perfectly."
"I no longer VLOOKUP(), I use this other function instead…","","+886","Negativity – This video is about stopping using a common function. Curiosity – Since VLOOKUP is a common and useful function, it’s counterintuitive to stop using it. Plus, this title opens up a loop at the end by not telling you what the other function is."
"8 Mind-Blowing Websites You Probably Didn’t Know Existed","","+6956","List – Have I told you lists make it easy to understand what the video is about and build curiosity? Curiosity – Describing these websites as “mind-blowing” and that “you probably didn’t know existed” builds curiosity."
"MY GO TO BEAUTY TOOLS AND MONTHLY SKINCARE REGIME 2022 | NINA UBHI","","-78","I think this video flopped because of the word “and”. Most successful videos are about a single topic, but this video is about two topics. In your titles, you want to make a big promise and deliver on it. When you start including multiple topics in your title you confuse your audience. And if you confuse you lose. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!

"Will The Housing Market Crash By The End of The Year? – What banks don’t want you to know","","+447","Curiosity – This title starts off building curiosity with a question, and then at the end opens a loop with the phrase, “What banks don’t want you to know.” Negativity – This video is about the housing market crash and about what banks don’t want you to know… lots of fear and conspiracy in there. Timeliness – This video does particularly well because the housing market crash is a hot topic right now. Time Frame – By limiting the scope of this video to just the end of the year, it makes it more tangible and even gives some urgency for you to watch it. Authority – Banks are an authority in this space, and this title makes them an enemy, which makes you want to watch it even more."
"Unlocking Lightroom’s Darkest Editing Secret!","","+523","Curiosity – Unlocking a secret builds a ton of curiosity, plus there’s contrast between Lightroom and darkest secret. Negativity – “Lightroom’s Darkest Secret” has a lot of drama and conspiracy vibes. Beginner tips – The thumbnail mentions beginners."
"Everything I Spend Money On For My 7-Figure Blog | Blogging Expenses","","+863","Curiosity – You feel like you’re getting in on a secret because you’re learning about where she spends her money, which can be a taboo subject. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to have a 7-figure blog."
"Voice Typing Changes Everything – So much more than Dictation!","","+1181","Curiosity – “Changes everything” opens a loop and makes you wonder how does it change everything and what changes.

"Breaking Down the Story Structure of Jurassic Park","","-77","The videos that perform best on this channel are about visual effects: Color Grading 101 – Everything You Need to Know



We Recreated a Shot from Obi-Wan Kenobi



Destroyed City Effect From Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness But this video is about storytelling.

"3 Major Ways To Earn Over $100,000 Per Month In Jamaica To Supplement Your 9-5 Income || ANNA NOVIA","","+400","Too good to be true – This video is not only about a desire everybody wants, but it’s about a desire that sounds almost too good to be true (another example coming later in this edition). List – People love clicking on list videos. Specific audience – If you live in Jamaica, you might feel like this video was made specifically for you, so you’re more likely to click and watch."
"how to change your life: 10 daily habits for 2022 *watch this if you’re feeling stuck*","","+530","Desire – Many people would love to change their lives, and for those who do, most want to do so really bad. List – People like clicking on list videos. Daily tips – We’ve got more daily tips here, and daily habits are attractive because we can just plug them into our routine and not worry about when or how often to do them.

"This Paint Trick Will Make CHEAP WHITE PAINT Cover + Hide As Well As The Most Expensive Brands!","","+938","Benefit – This video is about a benefit for the audience and it promises a lot for a little, which makes it more exciting. Curiosity – This title opens a loop by mentioning there’s a trick, but not telling you what the trick is."
"GARBAGE DISPOSAL NOT WORKING?! Try These Easy Fixes! (3 Sink Disposal Repairs…More Tips + Tricks!)","","-86","This title is more geared for search and will probably do well in the long term, but if you don’t have this specific problem right now, you’re probably not going to watch this video. That’s not the case with some of the other videos on this channel, like: NAILS vs. SCREWS…Which Should You Choose?!



Does SELF-PRIMING PAINT Really Work…Or Is It A Marketing Gimmick?



The Truth About PARTICLE BOARD…Is It The Worst Material?! Also, it seems like this creator’s audience might be more interested in building things than fixing things. This is a bit of a tough one to nail down why it flopped, but two lessons we can learn from it: Have a strategy for your video (i.e. browse vs. search) and have proper expectations for it

"Affordable Cities: 10 US Metro Areas With Underrated Livability, Walkability and Transit","","+464","Curiosity – The word “underrated” makes this title more fun and interesting, and “absurdly undervalued” in the thumbnail reiterates that. Desire – Many people would love to move to a more affordable city, or one with better livability, walkability and transit. Timeliness – With a recession looming and housing prices sky high, everybody has the word “affordable” on their mind right now. List – People like clicking on list videos."
"How I Would Learn To Code (If I Could Start Over)","","+892","Beginner tips – People love “if I could start over” stories. It meets your audience where they’re at. It’s mostly for beginners, and beginners are the biggest and hungriest subset of any audience."

"Teaching Abused And Terrified Dog To Stop Jumping In One Session","","-81","This title is too wordy. When you read it, it takes you too much time to understand what the video is about because the hook is buried behind too many words. This creator should’ve used “abused” or “terrified” in the title to make it shorter, not both of them. Plus, the thumbnail is confusing. I would’ve expected the jumping dog to be on the left and the well-behaved dog on the right. Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks! Have any questions about the hooks in this edition?

"9 DECORATING MISTAKES THAT COULD MAKE YOU DEPRESSED OR ANXIOUS","","+909","List – We’ve got another list here. Negativity – There are several aspects of negativity here.

"Swim without getting tired","","+1074","Benefit – Swimmers (this creator’s audience) would love to swim without getting tired. Refute an objection – This video refutes the “I can’t swim too long because I get too tired,” objection, so you’ve gotta watch and see how to do it. Great thumbnail – This thumbnail shows a clear contrast and progression to helping the audience achieve their goal that the title promises."
"The Intelligent Investor’s Road to $1,000,000","","+1138","Desire – Making $1,000,000 is a huge goal for this channel’s audience. Beginner tips – The thumbnail text tells you this is for beginners because it says “An investor’s first $1,000,000.”"
"Minimalist Kitchen Essentials | My traveling kitchen setup.","","-78","The majority of this creator’s audience probably cooks in their own kitchen. They don’t have or need a traveling kitchen setup, so they won’t watch this video. To avoid this mistake, really think about who your audience is and how you can serve them best.

"How Did MINAS ITHIL Become MINAS MORGUL? | Middle-Earth Lore","","+538","Curiosity – This title is a question, which evokes curiosity. Negativity – Minas Morgul is an evil city, and people love hearing about villains. Story – This video talks about changing from a good city to a bad city, so there’s a story behind it."
"Neuroscientist: “Never Feel Tired During The Day” | Andrew Huberman","","+833","Authority – Authority works because we know and trust authority figures. This title uses authority two ways: it uses his position (neuroscientist) and his name (Andrew Huberman). Negativity – The quote is about moving away from pain — never feeling tired — instead of moving toward pleasure, i.e. feeling energized. Desire – I, and I feel like I’m speaking for everybody reading this, would love to never feel tired during the day."
"how i plan to reinvent myself and change my life in one year | level up","","+1308","Desire – This creator’s audience would love to reinvent themselves and change their lives. Time frame – “In One Year” makes reinventing yourself and changing your life seem more achievable and tangible. Change Your Life – I’ve seen the term “change my life” come up a lot in this newsletter. People know what they have and they’re not satisfied, so “change your life” is so powerful."
"The Recession That Will Change A Generation","","+2941","Negativity – This video is about a negative event, a recession, plus the thumbnail text talks about the end of an era with a scary-looking graph. Timeliness – This video rides a current trend because everyone is talking about a recession. Change – Although this isn’t about changing your life, here’s the word change again. Change helps open a loop, which makes your curious, and starts a story."
"Let’s Discuss ADAPTING TOLKIEN! (Ft. The Script Department) | Middle-Earth Lore","","-76","Let’s get this out of the way first — this video is a podcast video, whereas most of the videos on this channel are voiceovers with cool animations and clips from the movies. That was probably a big reason why it flopped. But the title was also different. “Let’s Discuss” has no real benefit, fear, or curiosity, it’s just a plain statement. These creators should’ve taken the most interesting point in the interview and used that for the title, instead of leading with a bland “Let’s Discuss.” Alright, that wraps up this week’s Creator Hooks!
